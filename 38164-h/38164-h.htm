<p><b>SOME PRESENT-DAY LESSONS FROM
OLD WOODCUTS.</b></p>

<p><span class="smcap">By Alfred W. Pollard.</span></p>


<p><span class="dropcap012s"><span class="dropcap">S</span></span>OME explanation seems needed for
the intrusion of a talk about the woodcuts
of the fifteenth century into a
book dealing with the work of the
illustrators of our own day, and the
explanation, though no doubt discreditable,
is simple enough. It was to a mere bibliographer
that the idea occurred that lists of contemporary
illustrated books, with estimates of the work
found in them, might form a useful record of the
state of English book-illustration at the end of a
century in which for the first time (if we stretch
the century a little so as to include Bewick) it had
competed on equal terms with the work of foreign
artists. Fortunately the bibliographer's scanty
leisure was already heavily mortgaged, and so the
idea was transferred to a special student of the subject,
much better equipped for the task. But partly for
the pleasure of keeping a finger in an interesting pie,
partly because there was a fine hobby-horse waiting
to be mounted, the bibliographer bargained that he
should be allowed to write an introduction in which
his hobby should have free play, and the reader,
who has got a much better book than he was
intended to have, must acquiesce in this meddling,
or resort to his natural rights and skip.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span></p>

<p>It is well to ride a hobby with at least a semblance
of moderation, and the thesis which this introduction
is written to maintain does not assert that the woodcuts
of the fifteenth century are better than the
illustrations of the present day, only that our modern
artists, if they will condescend, may learn some useful
lessons from them. At the outset it may frankly be
owned that the range of the earliest illustrators was
limited. They had no landscape art, no such out-of-door
illustrations as those which furnish the
subject for one of Miss Sketchley's most interesting
chapters. Again, they had little humour, at least
of the voluntary kind, though this was hardly their
own fault, for as the admission is made the thought
at once follows it that of all the many deficiencies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
of fifteenth-century literature the lack of humour is
one of the most striking. The rough horseplay of
the Life of Aesop prefixed to editions of the Fables
can hardly be counted an exception; the wit combats
of Solomon and Marcolphus produced no more than
a title-cut showing king and clown, and outside the
'Dialogus Creaturarum' I can think of only a
single valid exception, itself rather satirical than
funny, this curious picture of a family on the move
from a French treatise on the Joys of Marriage. On
the 'Dialogus' itself it seems fair to lay some
stress, for surely the picture here shown of the Lion
and the Hare who applied for the post of his
secretary may well encourage us to believe that in
two other departments of illustration from which
also they were shut out, those of Caricature (for
which we must go back to thirteenth-century prayer-books)
and Christmas Books for Children, the
fifteenth-century artist would have made no mean
mark. It is, indeed, our Children's Gift-Books that
come nearest both to his feeling and his style.</p>

</div>

<p>What remains for us here to consider is the
achievement of the early designers and woodcutters
in the field of Decorative and Character Illustrations
with which Miss Sketchley deals in her first and third
chapters. Here the first point to be made is that by
an invention of the last twenty years they are brought
nearer to the possible work of our own day than to
that of any previous time. It has been often enough
pointed out that, not from preference, but from inability
to devise any better plan, the art of woodcut
illustration began on wholly wrong lines. Starting, as
was inevitable, from the colour-work of illuminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
manuscripts, the illustrators could think of no other
means of simplification than the reduction of pictures
to their outlines. With a piece of plank cut, not
across the grain of the wood, but with it, as his
material, and a sharp knife and, perhaps, a gouge
as his only tools, the woodcutter had to reproduce
these outlines as best he could, and it is little to be
wondered at if his lines were often scratchy and
angular, and many a good design was deplorably ill
handled. After a time, soft metal, presumably
pewter, was used as an alternative to wood, and
perhaps, though probably slower, was a little easier
to work successfully. But save in some Florentine
pictures and a few designs by Geoffroy Tory, the
craftsman's work was not to cut the lines which
the artist had drawn, but to cut away everything
else. This inverted method of work continued
after the invention of crosshatching to represent
shading, and was undoubtedly the cause of the rapid
supersession of woodcuts by copper engravings
during the sixteenth century, the more natural
method of work compensating for the trouble caused
when the illustrations no longer stood in relief like
the type, but had to be printed as incised plates,
either on separate leaves, or by passing the sheet
through a different press. The eighteenth-century
invention of wood-engraving as opposed to woodcutting
once again caused pictures and text to be
printed together, and the amazing dexterity of
successive schools of wood-engravers enabled them
to produce, though at the cost of immense labour,
work which seemed to compete on equal terms with
engravings on copper. At its best the wood-engraving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
of the nineteenth century was almost
miraculously good; at its worst, in the wood-engravings
of commerce&mdash;the wood-engravings of the
weekly papers, for which the artist's drawing might
come in on a Tuesday, to be cut up into little
squares and worked on all night as well as all day,
in the engravers' shops&mdash;it was unequivocally and
deplorably, but hardly surprisingly, bad.</p>

<p>Upon this strange medley of the miraculously
good and the excusably horrid came the invention
of the process line-block, and the problem which
had baffled so many fifteenth-century woodcutters,
of how to preserve the beauty of simple outlines
was solved at a single stroke. Have our modern
artists made anything like adequate use of this
excellent invention? My own answer would be
that they have used it, skilfully enough, to save
themselves trouble, but that its artistic possibilities
have been allowed to remain almost unexplored.
As for the trouble-saving&mdash;and trouble-saving is
not only legitimate but commendable&mdash;the photographer's
camera is the most obliging of craftsmen.
Only leave your work fairly open and you may draw
on as large a scale and with as coarse lines as you
please, and the camera will photograph it down for you
to the exact space the illustration has to fill and will
win you undeserved credit for delicacy and fineness
of touch as well. Thus to save trouble is well, but
to produce beautiful work is better, and what use
has been made of the fidelity with which beautiful
and gracious line can now be reproduced? The
caricaturists, it is true, have seen their opportunity.
Cleverness could hardly be carried further than it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
by Mr. Phil May, and a caricaturist of another sort,
the late Mr. Aubrey Beardsley, degenerate and
despicable as was almost every figure he drew, yet
saw and used the possibilities which artists of happier
temperament have neglected. With all the disadvantages
under which they laboured in the reproduction
of fine line the craftsmen of Venice and
Florence essayed and achieved more than this.
Witness the fine rendering into pure line of a picture
by Gentile Bellini of a tall preacher preceded by
his little crossbearer in the 'Doctrina' of Lorenzo
Giustiniano printed at Venice in 1494, or again the
impressiveness, surviving even its little touch of the
grotesque, of this armed warrior kneeling at the feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>
of a pope, which I have unearthed from a favourite
volume of Venetian chapbooks at the British
Museum. A Florentine picture of Jacopone da
Todi on his knees before a vision of the Blessed
Virgin (from Bonacorsi's edition of his 'Laude,'
1490) gives another instance of what can be done
by simple line in a different style. We have yet
other examples in many of the illustrations to the
famous romance, the 'Hypnerotomachia Poliphili,'
printed at Venice in 1499. Of similar cuts on a
much smaller scale, a specimen will be given later.
Here, lest anyone should despise these fifteenth-century
efforts, I would once more recall the fact
that at the time they were made the execution of
such woodcuts required the greatest possible dexterity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
in cutting away on each side so as to leave the
line as the artist drew it with any semblance of its
original grace. In many illustrated books which
have come down to us what must have been
beautiful designs have been completely spoilt,
rendered even grotesque, by the fine curves of the
drawing being translated into scratchy angularities.
But draw he never so finely no artist nowadays need
fear that his work will be made scratchy or angular
by photographic process. It is only when he
crowds lines together, from inability to work simply,
that the process block aggravates his defects.</p>

<p>I pass on to another point as to which I think
the Florentine woodcutters have something to teach
us. If we put pictures into our books, why should
not the pictures be framed? A hard single line
round the edge of a woodcut is a poor set-off to it,
often conflicting with the lines in the picture itself,
and sometimes insufficiently emphatic as a frame
to make us acquiesce in what seems a mere cutting
away a portion from a larger whole. Our Florentine
friends knew better. Here (pp. xiv-xv), for instance,
are two scenes, from some unidentified romance,
which in 1572 and 1555 respectively (by which time
they must have been about fifty and sixty years old)
appeared in Florentine religious chapbooks, with
which they have nothing to do. The little borders
are simple enough, but they are sufficiently heavy
to carry off the blacks which the artist (according
to what is the true method of woodcutting) has left
in his picture, and we are much less inclined to
grumble at the window being cut in two than we
should be if the cut were made by a simple line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>
instead of quite firmly and with determination by a
frame.</p>

<p>I have given these two Florentine cuts, much the
worse for wear though they be, with peculiar
pleasure, because I take them to be the exact
equivalents of the pictures in our illustrated novels
of the present day of which Miss Sketchley gives
several examples in her third paper. They are good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
examples of what may be called the diffused characterization
in which our modern illustrators excel.
Every single figure is good and has its own individuality,
but there is no attempt to illustrate a central
character at a decisive moment. Decisive moments,
it may be objected, do not occur (except for epicures)
at polite dinner parties, or during the 'mauvais<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
quart d'heure,' which might very well be the
subject of our first picture. But it seems to me
that modern illustrators often deliberately shun
decisive moments, preferring to illustrate their
characters in more ordinary moods, and perhaps the
Florentines did this also. Where the illustrator is
not a great artist the discretion is no doubt a wise
one. What for instance could be more charming,
more completely successful than this little picture
of a messenger bringing a lady a flower, no doubt
with a pleasing message with it? In our next cut
the artist has been much more ambitious. Preceded
by soldiers with their long spears, followed by the
hideously masked 'Battuti' who ministered to the
condemned, Ippolito is being led to execution. As
he passes her door, Dianora flings herself on him in
a last embrace. The lady's attitude is good, but the
woodcutter, alas, has made the lover look merely
bored. In book-illustration, as in life, who would
avoid failure must know his limitations.</p>

<p>Whatever shortcomings these Florentine pictures
may have in themselves, or whatever they may lose
when examined by eyes only accustomed to modern
work, I hope that it will be conceded that as character-illustrations
they are far from being despicable.
Nevertheless the true home of character-illustration
in the fifteenth century was rather in Germany than
in Italy. Inferior to the Italian craftsmen in delicacy
and in producing a general impression of grace
(partly, perhaps, because their work was intended
to be printed in conjunction with far heavier type)
the German artists and woodcutters often showed
extraordinary power in rendering facial expression.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
My favourite example of this is a little picture from
the 'De Claris Mulieribus' of Boccaccio printed
at Ulm in 1473, on one side of which the Roman
general Scipio is shown with uplifted finger bidding
the craven Massinissa put away his Carthaginian
wife, while on the other Sophonisba is watched by
a horror-stricken messenger as she drains the poison
her husband sends her. But there is a naïveté about
the figure of Scipio which has frequently provoked
laughter from audiences at lantern-lectures, so my
readers must look up this illustration for themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
at the British Museum, or elsewhere. I fall back
on a picture of a card-party from a 'Guldin Spiel'
printed at Augsburg in 1472, in which the hesitation
of the woman whose turn it is to play, the
rather supercilious interest of her vis-à-vis, and the
calm confidence of the third hand, not only ready
to play his best, but sure that his best will be good
enough, are all shown with absolute simplicity, but
in a really masterly manner. Facial expression such
as this in modern work seems entirely confined to
children's books and caricature, but one would
sacrifice a good deal of our modern prettiness for a
few more touches of it.</p>

<p>The last point to which I would draw attention
is that a good deal more use might be made of quite
small illustrations. The full-pagers are, no doubt,
impressive and dignified, but I always seem to see
written on the back of them the artist's contract to
supply so many drawings of such and such size at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
so many guineas apiece, and to hear him groaning
as he runs through his text trying to pick out the
full complement of subjects. The little sketch is
more popular in France than in England, and there
is a suggestion of joyous freedom about it which is
very captivating. Such small pictures did not suit
the rather heavy touch of the German woodcutters;
in Italy they were much more popular. At Venice
a whole series of large folio books were illustrated in
this way in the last decade of the fifteenth century,
two editions of Malermi's translation of the Bible,
Lives of the Saints, an Italian Livy, the Decamerone
of Boccaccio, the Novels of Masuccio, and other
works, all in the vernacular. At Ferrara, under
Venetian influence, an edition of the Epistles of S.
Jerome was printed in 1497, with upwards of one
hundred and eighty such little cuts, many of them
illustrating incidents of monastic life. Both at
Venice and Ferrara the cuts are mainly in outline,
and when they are well cut and two or three come
together on a page the effect is delightful. In
France the vogue of the small cut took a very special
form. By far the most famous series of early French
illustrated books is that of the Hours of the Blessed
Virgin (with which went other devotions, making
fairly complete prayer-books for lay use), which
were at their best for some fifteen years reckoning
from 1488. These Hour-Books usually contained
some fifteen large illustrations, but their most notable
features are to be found in the borders which
surround every page. On the outer and lower
margins these borders are as a rule about an inch
broad, sometimes more, so that they can hold four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvi" id="Page_xxvi">[Pg xxvi]</a></span>
or five little pictures of about an inch by an
inch and a half on the outer margin, and one
rather larger one at the foot of the page. The
variety of the pictures designed to fill these spaces
is almost endless. Figures of the Saints and their
emblems and illustrations of the games or occupations
suited to each month fill the margins of the Calendar.
To surround the text of the book there is a long
series of pictures of incidents in the life of Christ,
with parallel scenes from the Old Testament, scenes
from the lives of Joseph and Job, representations of
the Virtues, the Deadly Sins being overcome by
the contrary graces, the Dance of Death, and for
pleasant relief woodland and pastoral scenes and even
grotesques. The popularity of these prayer-books
was enormous, new editions being printed almost
every month, with the result that the illustrations
were soon worn out and had frequently to be
replaced. I have often wished, if only for the sake
of small children in sermon time, that our English
prayer-books could be similarly illustrated. An
attempt to do this was made in the middle of the
last century, but it was pretentious and unsuccessful.
The great difficulty in the way of a new essay lies
in the popularity of very small prayer-books, with
so little margin and printed on such thin paper as
hardly to admit of border cuts. The difficulty is
real, but should not be insuperable, and I hope that
some bold illustrator may soon try his hand afresh.</p>

<p>I should not be candid if I closed this paper
without admitting that my fifteenth-century friends
anticipated modern publishers in one of their worst
faults, the dragging in illustrations where they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxvii" id="Page_xxvii">[Pg xxvii]</a></span>
not wanted. In the fifteenth century the same cuts
were repeated over and over again in the same book
to serve for different subjects. Modern publishers
are not so simple-hearted as this, but they add to
the cost of their books by unpleasant half-tone
reproductions of unnecessary portraits and views,
and I do not think that book-buyers are in the least
grateful to them. Miss Sketchley, I am glad to see,
has not concerned herself with illustrators whose
designs require to be produced by the half-tone
process. To condemn this process unreservedly
would be absurd. It gives us illustrations which
are really needed for the understanding of the text
when they could hardly be produced in any other
way, and while it does this it must be tolerated.
But by necessitating the use of heavily-loaded paper&mdash;unpleasant
to the touch, heavy in the hand,
doomed, unless all the chemists are wrong, speedily
to rot&mdash;it is the greatest danger to the excellence of
our English book-work which has at present to be
faced, while by wearying readers with endless
mechanically produced pictures it is injurious also
to the best interests of artistic illustration.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxviii" id="Page_xxviii">[Pg xxviii]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap032o"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>F the famous 'Poems by Alfred Tennyson,'
published in 1857 by Edward
Moxon, Mr. Gleeson White wrote in
1897: 'The whole modern school of
decorative illustrators regard it, rightly
enough, as the genesis of the modern
movement.' The statement may need some modification
to touch exact truth, for the 'modern
movement' is no single-file, straightforward movement.
'Kelmscott,' 'Japan,' the 'Yellow Book,'
black-and-white art in Germany, in France, in
Spain, in America, the influence of Blake, the style
of artists such as Walter Crane, have affected the
present form of decorative book-illustration. Such
perfect unanimity of opinion as is here ascribed to
a large and rather indefinitely related body of men
hardly exists among even the smallest and most
derided body of artists. Still, allowing for the impossibility
of telling the whole truth about any
modern and eclectic form of art in one sentence,
there is here a statement of fact. What Rossetti
and Millais and Holman Hunt achieved in the
drawings to the 'Tennyson' of 1857, was a vital
change in the intention of English illustrative art,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
and whatever form decorative illustration may
assume, their ideal is effective while a personal
interpretation of the spirit of the text is the creative
impulse. The influence of technical mastery is
strong and enduring enough. It is constantly in
sight and constantly in mind. But it is in discovering
and making evident a principle in art that the
influence of spirit on spirit becomes one of the
illimitable powers.</p>

<p>To Rossetti the illustration of literature meant
giving beautiful form to the expression of delight,
of penetration, that had kindled his imagination as
he read. He illustrated the 'Palace of Art' in the
spirit that stirred him to rhythmic translation into
words of the still music in Giorgione's 'Pastoral,'
or of the unpassing movement of Mantegna's
'Parnassus.' Not the words of the text, nor those
things precisely affirmed by the writer, but the
spell of significance and of beauty that held his
mind to the exclusion of other images, gave him
inspiration for his drawings. As Mr. William
Michael Rossetti says: 'He drew just what he
chose, taking from his author's text nothing more
than a hint and an opportunity.' It is said, indeed,
that Tennyson could never see what the St. Cecily
drawing had to do with his poem. And that is
strange enough to be true.</p>

<p>It is clear that such an ideal of illustration is for
the attainment of a few only. The ordinary illustrator,
making drawings for cheap reproduction in
the ordinary book, can no more work in this mood
than the journalist can model his style on the prose
of Milton. But journalism is not literature, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
pictured matter-of-fact is not illustration, though it
is convenient and customary to call it so. However,
here one need not consider this, for the decorative
illustrator has usually literature to illustrate,
and a commission to be beautiful and imaginative
in his work. He has the opportunity of Rossetti,
the opportunity for significant art.</p>

<p>The 'Classics' and children's books give greatest
opportunity to decorative illustrators. Those who
have illustrated children's books chiefly, or whose
best work has been for the playful classics of literature,
it is convenient to consider in a separate
chapter, though there are instances where the
division is not maintainable: Walter Crane, for
example, whose influence on a school of decorative
design makes his position at the head of his following
imperative.</p>

<p>Representing the 'architectural' sense in the
decoration of books, many years before the supreme
achievements of William Morris added that ideal
to generally recognized motives of book-decoration,
Walter Crane is the precursor of a large and prolific
school of decorative illustrators. Many factors,
as he himself tells, have gone to the shaping of his
art. Born in 1846 at Liverpool, he came to London
in 1857, and there after two years was 'apprenticed'
to Mr. W. J. Linton, the well-known
wood-engraver. His work began with 'the sixties,'
in contact with the enthusiasm and inspiration those
years brought into English art. The illustrated
'Tennyson,' and Ruskin's 'Elements of Drawing,'
were in his thoughts before he entered Mr. Linton's
workshop, and the 'Once a Week' school had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
a strong influence on his early contributions to
'Good Words,' 'Once a Week,' and other famous
magazines. In 1865 Messrs. Warne published the
first toy-book, and by 1869-70 the 'Walter Crane
Toy-book' was a fact in art. The sight of some
Japanese colour-prints during these years suggested
a finer decorative quality to be obtained with tint
and outline, and in the use of black, as well as in
a more delicate simplicity of colour, the later toy-books
show the first effect of Japanese art on the
decorative art of England. Italian art in England
and Italy, the prints of Dürer, the Parthenon sculptures,
these were influences that affected him
strongly. 'The Baby's Opera' (1877) and 'The
Baby's Bouquet' (1879) are classics almost impossible
to criticise, classics familiar from cover to
cover before one was aware of any art but the art
on their pages. So that if these delightful designs
seem less expressive of the Greece, Germany, and
Italy of the supreme artists than of the 'Crane'
countries by whose coasts ships 'from over the sea'
go sailing by with strange cargoes and strange crews,
it is not in their dispraise. As a decorative draughtsman
Mr. Crane is at his best when the use of colour
gives clearness to the composition, but some of his
most 'serious' work is in the black-and-white pages
of 'The Sirens Three,' of 'The Shepheardes Calendar,'
and especially of 'The Faerie Queene.' The
number of books he has illustrated&mdash;upwards of
seventy&mdash;makes a detailed account impossible.
Nursery rhyme and fairy books, children's stories,
Spenser, Shakespeare, the myths of Greece, 'pageant
books' such as 'Flora's Feast' or 'Queen
Summer,' or the just published 'Masque of Days,'
his own writings, serious or gay, have given him
subjects, as the great art of all times has touched
the ideals of his art.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>
<p>But whatever the subject, how strong soever his
artistic admirations, he is always Walter Crane,
unmistakable at a glance. Knights and ladies,
fairies and fairy people, allegorical figures, nursery
and school-room children, fulfil his decorative purpose
without swerving, though not always without
injury to their comfort and freedom and the life in
their limbs. An individual apprehension that sees
every situation as a conventional 'arrangement' is
occasionally beside the mark in rendering real life.
But when his theme touches imagination, and is not
a supreme expression of it&mdash;for then, as in the
illustrations to 'The Faerie Queene,' an unusual
sense of subservience appears to dull his spirit&mdash;his
humorous fancy knows no weariness nor sameness
of device.</p>

<p>The work of most of Mr. Crane's followers
belongs to 'the nineties,' when the 'Arts and Crafts'
movement, the 'Century Guild,' the Birmingham
and other schools had attracted or produced artists
working according to the canons of Kelmscott.
Mr. Heywood Sumner was earlier in the field.
The drawings to 'Sintram' (1883) and to 'Undine'
(1888) show his art as an illustrator. Undine&mdash;spirit
of wind and water, flower-like in gladness&mdash;seeking
to win an immortal soul by submission to
the forms of life, is realized in the gracefully designed
figures of frontispiece and title-page. Where
Mr. Sumner illustrates incident he is 'factual'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
without being matter-of-fact. The small drawing
reproduced is hardly representative of his art, but
most of his work is adapted to a squarer page than
this, and has had to be rejected on that account.
Some of the most apt
decorations in 'The
English Illustrated' were
by Mr. Sumner, and
during the time when
art was represented in
the magazine Mr. Ryland
and Mr. Louis
Davis were also frequent
contributors. The graceful
figures of Mr. Ryland,
uninterested in
activity, a garden-world
set with statues around
them, and the carol-like
grace of Mr. Davis's designs
in that magazine,
represent them better
than the one or two
books they have illustrated.</p>

<p>Among those associated
with the 'Arts and
Crafts' who have given
more of their art to book-decoration, Mr. Anning
Bell is first. He has gained the approval even of
the most exigent of critics as an artist who understands
drawing for process. Since 1895, when the
'Midsummer Night's Dream' appeared, his winning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
art has been praised with discrimination and
without discrimination, but always praised. Trained
in an architect's office, widely known as the recreator
of coloured relief for architectural decoration,
Mr. Anning Bell's illustrations show constructive
power no less than that fairy gift of seeming
to improvise without labour and without hesitancy,
which is one of its especial charms. In feeling, and
in many of his decorative forms, his drawings recall
the art of Florentine bas-relief, when Agostino
di Duccio, or Rossellino or Mino da Fiesole, created
shapes of delicate sweetness, pure, graceful&mdash;so
graceful that their power is hardly realized. The
fairy by-play of the 'Midsummer Night's Dream'
is exactly to Mr. Anning Bell's fancy. He knows
better than to go about to expound this dream, and
it is not likely that a more delightful edition will
ever be put into the hands of children, or of anyone,
than this in the white and gold cover devised by the
artist.</p>

<p>Of his illustrations to the 'Poems by John
Keats' (1897), and to the 'English Lyrics from
Spenser to Milton' of the following year&mdash;as
illustrations&mdash;not quite so much can be said, distinguished
and felicitous as many of them are.
The simple profile, the demure type of beauty
that he affects, hardly suit with Isabella when she
hears that Lorenzo has gone from her, with Lamia
by the clear pool</p>

Anning Bell's drawings to 'The Pilgrim's Progress'
(1898) reveal him in a different mood, as
do those in 'The Christian Year' of three years
earlier. His vision is hardly energetic enough, his
energy of belief sufficient, to make him a strong
illustrator of Bunyan, with his many moods, his
great mood. A little these designs suggest Howard
Pyle, and Anning Bell is better in a way of beauty
not Gothic.</p>

<p>So if Mr. Anning Bell represents the 'Arts and
Crafts' movement in the variety of decorative arts
he has practised, and in the architectural sense
underlying all his art, his work does not agree
with the form in which the influence of William
Morris on decorative illustration has chiefly shown
itself. That form, of course, is Gothic, as the
ideal of Kelmscott was Gothic. The work of the
'Century Guild' artists as decorative illustrators is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
chiefly in the pages of 'The Hobby Horse.' Mr.
Selwyn Image and Mr. Herbert Horne can hardly
be included among book illustrators, so in this connection
one may not stop to consider the decorative
strength of their ideal in art. The Birmingham
school represents Gothic ideals with determination
and rigidity. Morris addressed the students of the
school and prefaced the edition of 'Good King
Wenceslas,' decorated and engraved and printed by
Mr. A. J. Gaskin 'at the press of the Guild of
Handicraft in the City of Birmingham,' with cordial
words of appreciation for the pictures. These illustrations
are among the best Mr. Gaskin has done.
The commission for twelve full-page drawings to
'The Shepheardes Calendar' (Kelmscott Press,
1896) marks Morris's pleasure in Mr. Gaskin's
work&mdash;especially in the illustrations to Andersen's
'Stories and Fairy Tales.' If not quite in tune
with Spenser's Elizabethan idyllism, these drawings
are distinctive of the definite convictions of the
artist.</p>

</div>

<p>These convictions represent a splendid tradition.
They are expressive, in their regard for the unity
of the page, for harmony between type and decoration,
of the universal truth in all fine bookmaking.
Only at times, Birmingham work seems
rather heavy in spirit, rather too rigid for development.
Still, judging by results, a code that would
appear to be against individual expression is inspiring
individual artists. Some of these&mdash;as Mr.
E. H. New&mdash;have turned their attention to architectural
and 'open-air' illustration, in which connection
their work will be considered, and many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
have illustrated children's books. Their quaint and
naïve fancy has there, at times, produced a portentous
embodiment of the 'old-fashioned' child
of fiction. Mr. Gere, though he has done little
book-illustration, is one of the strongest artists of
the school. His original wood engravings show
unmistakably his decorative power and his craftsmanship.
With Mr. K. Fairfax Muckley he was
responsible for 'The Quest' (1894-96). Mr. Fairfax
Muckley has illustrated and decorated a three-volume
edition of 'The Faerie Queene' (1897),
wherein the forest branches and winding ways of
woodland and of plain are more happily conventionalized
than are Spenser's figures. Some of the
headpieces are especially successful. The artist
uses the 'mixed convention' of solid black and line
with less confusion than many modern draughtsmen.
Once its dangers must have been evident,
but now the puzzle pattern, with solid blacks in
the foreground, background, and mid-distance&mdash;only
there is no distance in these drawings&mdash;is a
common form of black and white.</p>

<p>Miss Celia Levetus, Mr. Henry Payne, Mr. F.
Mason, and Mr. Bernard Sleigh, are also to the
credit of the school. Miss Levetus, in her later
work, shows that an inclination towards a more
flexible style is not incompatible with the training
in Gothic convention. Mr. Mason's illustrations
to ancient romances of chivalry give evidence of
conscientious craftsmanship, and of a spirit sympathetic
to themes such as 'Renaud of Montauban.'
Mr. Bernard Sleigh's original wood-engravings are
well known and justly appreciated. Strong in tradition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
and logic as is the work of these designers, it
is, for many, too consistent with convention to be
delightful. Perhaps the best result of the Birmingham
school will hardly be achieved until the formal
effect of its training is less patent.</p>

<p>The 'sixties' might have been void of art, so
far as these designers are concerned, save that in
those days Morris and Burne-Jones and Walter
Crane, as well as Millais and Houghton and Sandys,
were about their work. Far other is the case with
artists such as Mr. Byam Shaw, or with the many
draughtsmen, including Messrs. P. V. Woodroffe,
Henry Ospovat, Philip Connard, and Herbert Cole,
whose art derives its form and intention from the
sixties. Differing in technical power and fineness
of invention, in all that distinguishes good from less
good, they have this in common&mdash;that the form of
their art would have been quite other if the illustrated
books of that period were among things unseen.
Mr. Byam Shaw began his work as an illustrator in
1897 with a volume of 'Browning's Poems,' edited
by Dr. Garnett. He proved himself in these drawings,
as in his pictures and later illustrations, an
artist with a definite memory for the forms, and a
genuine sympathy with the aims of pre-Raphaelite
art. Evidently, too, he admires the black-and-white
of Mr. Abbey. He has the gift of dramatic
conception, sees a situation at high pitch, and has
a pleasant way of giving side-lights, pictorial asides,
by means of decorative head and tailpieces. His
illustrations to the little green and gold volumes
of the 'Chiswick Shakespeare' are more emphatic
than his earlier work, and in the decorations his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
power of summarizing the chief motive is put to
good use. There is no need of his signature to distinguish
the work of Byam Shaw, though he shows
himself under the influence of various masters.
Probably he is only an illustrator of books by the
way, but in the meantime, as the 'Boccaccio,'
'Browning,' and 'Shakespeare' drawings show, he
works in black and white with vigorous intention.</p>

<p>Mr. Ospovat's illustrations to 'Shakespeare's
Sonnets' and to 'Matthew Arnold's Poems' are
interesting, if not very markedly his own. He
illustrates the Sonnets as a celebration of a poet's
passion for his mistress. As in these, so in the
Matthew Arnold drawings, he shows some genuine
creative power and an aptitude for illustrative decoration.
Mr. Philip Connard has made spirited
and well-realized illustrations in somewhat the same
kind; Miss Amelia Bauerle, and Mr. Bulcock,
who began by illustrating 'The Blessed Damozel'
in memory of Rossetti, have made appearance in
the 'Flowers of Parnassus' series, and Mr. Herbert
Cole, with three of these little green volumes, prepared
one for more important work in 'Gulliver's
Travels' (1900).</p>

<p>The work of Mr. Woodroffe was, I think, first
seen in the 'Quarto'&mdash;the organ of the Slade
School&mdash;where also Mr. A. Garth Jones, Mr. Cyril
Goldie, and Mr. Robert Spence, gave unmistakable
evidence of individuality. Mr. Woodroffe's wood-engravings
in the 'Quarto' showed strength, which
is apparent, too, in the delicately characterized
figures to 'Songs from Shakespeare's Plays' (1898),
with their borders of lightly-strung field flowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
His drawings to 'The Confessions of S. Augustine,'
engraved by Miss Clemence Housman, are in keeping
with the text, not impertinent. Mr. A. Garth
Jones in the 'Quarto' seemed much influenced by
Japanese grotesques; but in illustrations to Milton's
'Minor Poems' (1898) he has shown development
towards the expression of beauty more austere,
classical, controlled to the presentment of Milton's
high thought. His recent 'Essays of Elia' remind
one of the forcible work of Mr. E. J. Sullivan
in 'Sartor Resartus.' Mr. Sullivan's 'Sartor'
and 'Dream of Fair Women' must be mentioned.
His mastery over an assertive use of line and solid
black, the unity of his effects, the humour and
imagination of his decorative designs, are not likely
to be forgotten, though the balance of his work in
illustrations to Sheridan, Marryat, Sir Walter Scott,
obliges one to class him with "character" illustrators,
and so to leave a blank in this article.</p>

<p>Mr. Laurence Housman stands alone among
modern illustrators, though one may, if one will,
speak of him as representing the succession of the
sixties, or as connected with the group of artists
whose noteworthy development dates from the
publication of 'The Dial' by Charles Ricketts and
Charles Shannon in 1889. To look at Mr. Housman's
art in either connection, or to record the
effect of Dürer, of Blake, of Edward Calvert, on
his technique, is only to come back to appreciation
of all that is his own. As an illustrator he has
hardly surpassed the spirit of the 'forty-four designs,
drawn and written by Laurence Housman,'
that express his idea of George Meredith's 'Jump<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
to Glory Jane' (1890). These designs were the
result of the appreciation which the editor, Mr.
Harry Quilter, felt for Mr. Housman's drawings
to 'The Green Gaffer' in 'The Universal Review.'
Jane&mdash;the village woman with 'wistful eyes in
a touching but bony face,' leaping with countenance
composed, arms and feet 'like those who
hang,' leaping in crude expression of the unity of
soul and body, making her converts, failing to
move the bishop, dying at last, though not ingloriously,
by the wayside&mdash;this most difficult
conception has no 'burlesque outline' in Mr.
Housman's work, inexperienced and unacademic
as is the drawing.</p>

<p>'Weird Tales from Northern Seas,' by Jonas Lie,
was the next book illustrated by Mr. Housman.
Christina Rossetti's 'Goblin Market' (1893), offered
greater scope for freakish imagination than did
'Jane.' The goblins, pale-eyed, mole and rat and
weasel-faced; the sisters, whose simple life they
surround with hideous fantasy, are realized in harmony
with the unique effect of the poem&mdash;an
effect of simplicity, of naïve imagination, of power,
of things stranger than are told in the cry of the
goblin merchants, as at evening time they invade
quiet places to traffic with their evil fruits for the
souls of maidens. The frail-bodied elves of 'The
End of Elfin Town,' moving and sleeping among
the white mushrooms and slender stalks of field
flowers, are of another land than that of the goblin
merchant-folk. Illustrations to 'The Imitation of
Christ,' to 'The Sensitive Plant,' and drawings to
'The Were-Wolf,' by Miss Clemence Housman,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
complete the list of Mr. Housman's illustrations
to writings not his own, with the exception of
frontispiece drawings to several books.</p>

<span class="caption">MERCURY GOD OF MERCHANDISE LOOK ON WITH FAVOURABLE EYES<br /><br />

</div>

<p>To explain Mr. Housman's vision of 'The
Sensitive Plant' would be as superfluous as it would
be ineffectual. In a note on the illustrations he
has told how the formal beauty, the exquisite
ministrations, the sounds and fragrance and sweet
winds of the garden enclosed, seem to him as 'a
form of beauty that springs out of modes and
fashions,' too graceful to endure. In his pictures he
has realized the perfect ensemble of the garden, its
sunny lawns and rose-trellises, its fountains, statues,
and flower-sweet ways; realized, too, the spirit of
the Sensitive Plant, the lady of the garden, and
Pan, the great god who never dies, who waits only
without the garden, till in a little while he enters,
'effacing and replacing with his own image and
superscription, the parenthetic grace ... of the
garden deity.'</p>

<p>Of a talent that treats always of enchanted
places, where 'reality' is a long day's journey
down a dusty road, it is difficult to speak without
suggesting that it is all just a charming dalliance
with pretty fancies, lacking strength. Of the
strength of Mr. Housman's imagination, however,
his work speaks. His illustrations to his own
writings, fairy tales, and poems, cannot with any
force be discussed by themselves. The words belong
to the pictures, the pictures to the words.
The drawings to 'The Field of Clover' are seen to
full advantage in the wood-engravings of Miss
Housman. Only so, or in reproduction by photogravure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
is the full intention of Mr. Housman's
pen-drawings apparent.</p>

<p>One may group the names of Charles Ricketts,
C. H. Shannon, T. Sturge Moore, Lucien Pissarro,
and Reginald Savage together in memory of 'The
Dial,' where the activity of five original artists
first became evident, though, save in the case of
Mr. Ricketts and Mr. Shannon, no continuance of
the classification is possible. The first number of
'The Dial' (1889) had a cover design cut on wood
by Mr. C. H. Shannon&mdash;afterwards replaced by
the design of Mr. Ricketts. Twelve designs by
Mr. Ricketts may be said to represent the transitional&mdash;or
a transitional&mdash;phase of his art, from the
earlier work in magazines, which he disregards, to
the reticent expression of 'Vale Press' illustrations.
In 1891 the first book decorated by these artists
appeared, 'The House of Pomegranates,' by Oscar
Wilde. There was, however, nothing in this book
to suggest the form their joint talent was to take.
Many delightful designs by Mr. Ricketts, somewhat
marred by heaviness of line, and full-page illustrations
by Mr. Shannon, printed in an almost invisible,
nondescript colour, contained no suggestion of
'Daphnis and Chloe.'</p>

<p>The second 'Dial'(1892) contained Mr. Ricketts'
first work as his own wood-engraver, and in the
following year the result of eleven months' joint
work by Mr. Ricketts and Mr. Shannon was shown
in the publication of 'Daphnis and Chloe,' with
thirty-seven woodcuts by the artists. Fifteen of
the pictures were sketched by Mr. Shannon and
revised and drawn on the wood by Mr. Ricketts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
who also engraved the initials. It is a complete
achievement of individuality subordinated to an
ideal. Here and there one can affirm that Mr.
Shannon drew this figure, composed this scene,
Mr. Ricketts that; but generally the hand is not to
be known. The ideal of their inspiration&mdash;the immortal
'Hypnerotomachia'&mdash;seems equally theirs,
equally potent over their individuality. Speaking
with diffidence, it would seem as though Mr.
Shannon's idea of the idyll were more naïve and
humorous. Incidents beside the main theme of
the pastoral loves of young Daphnis and Chloe&mdash;the
household animals, other shepherds&mdash;are
touched with humorous intent. Mr. Ricketts
shows more suavity, and, as in the charming double-page
design of the marriage feast, a more lyrical
realization of delight and shepherd joys.</p>

<p>The 'Hero and Leander' of 1894 is a less
elaborate, and, on the whole, a finer production.
I must speak of the illustrations only, lest consideration
of Vale Press publications should fill
the remaining space at my disposal. Obviously
the attenuated type of these figures shows Mr.
Ricketts' ideal of the human form as a decoration
for a page of type. The severe reticence he
imposes on himself is in order to maintain the
balance between illustrations and text. One has
only to turn to illustrations to Lord de Tabley's
'Poems,' published in 1893, to see with what eager
imagination he realizes a subject, how strong a gift
he has for dramatic expression. That a more persuasive
beauty of form was once his wont, much of
his early and transitional work attests. But I do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
not think his power to achieve beauty need be defended.
After the publication of 'Hero and
Leander,' Mr. Shannon practically ceased wood-engraving
for the illustration of books, though, as
the series of roundel designs in the recent exhibition
of his work proved, he has not abandoned nor
ceased to go forward in the art.</p>

<p>'The Sphinx,' a poem by Oscar Wilde, 'built,
decorated and bound' by Mr. Ricketts&mdash;but without
woodcuts&mdash;was published in 1894, just after
'Hero and Leander,' and designs for a magnificent
edition of 'The King's Quhair' were begun.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
Some of these are in 'The Dial,' as are also designs
for William Adlington's translation of 'Cupide and
Psyches' in 'The Pageant,' 'The Dial,' and 'The
Magazine of Art.' The edition of the work published
by the new Vale Press in 1897, is not that
projected at this time. It contains roundel designs
in place of the square designs first intended. These
roundels are, I think, the finest achievement of
Mr. Ricketts as an original wood-engraver. The
engraving reproduced shows of what quality are
both line and form, how successful is the placing
of the figure within the circle. On the page they
are what the artist would have them be. With
the beginning of the sequence of later Vale Press
books&mdash;books printed from founts designed by Mr.
Ricketts&mdash;a consecutive account is impossible, but
the frontispiece to the 'Milton' and the borders and
initials designed by Mr. Ricketts, must be mentioned.
As a designer of book-covers only one failure is set
down to Mr. Ricketts, and that was ten years ago,
in the cover to 'The House of Pomegranates.'</p>

<p>Mr. Reginald Savage's illustrations to some
tales from Wagner lack the force of designs in
'The Pageant,' and of woodcuts in Essex House
publications. Of M. Lucien Pissarro, in an article
overcrowded with English illustrators, I cannot
speak. His fame is in France as the forerunner of
his art, and we in England know his coloured wood-engravings,
his designs for 'The Book of Ruth and
Esther' and for 'The Queen of the Fishes,' printed
at his press at Epping, but included among Vale
Press books.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p>'The Centaur,' 'The Bacchant,' 'The Metamorphoses
of Pan,' 'Siegfried'&mdash;young Siegfried,
wood-nurtured, untamed, setting his lusty strength
against the strength of the brutes, hearing the bird-call
then, and following the white bird to issues
remote from savage life&mdash;these are subjects realized
by the imagination of Mr. T. Sturge Moore.
There are few artists illustrating books to-day whose
work is more unified, imaginatively and technically.
It is some years since first Mr. Moore's wood-engravings
attracted notice in 'The Dial' and
'The Pageant,' and the latest work from his graver&mdash;finer,
more rhythmic in composition though it
be&mdash;shows no change in ideals, in the direction of
his talent. He has said, I think, that the easiest
line for the artist is the true basis of that artist's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
work, and it would seem as though much deliberation
in finding that line for himself had preceded
any of the work by which he is known. The
wood-engraving of Mr. Sturge Moore is of some
importance. Always the true understanding of his
material, the unhesitating realization of his subject,
combine to produce the effect of inevitable line
and form, of an inevitable setting down of forms
in expression of the thought within. Only that
gives the idea of formality, and Mr. Moore's art
handles the strong impulse of the wild creatures
of earth, of the solitary creatures, mighty and
terrible, haunting the desert places and fearing the
order men make for safety. Designs to Wordsworth's
'Poems,' not yet published, represent with
innate perception the earth-spirit as Wordsworth
knew it, when the great mood of 'impassioned
contemplation' came upon his careful spirit, when
his heart leapt up, or when, wandering beneath the
wind-driven clouds of March, at sight of daffodils,
he lost his loneliness.</p>

<p>'The Evergreen,' that 'Northern Seasonal,' represented
the pictorial outlook of an interesting
group of artists&mdash;Robert Burns, Andrew K. Womrath,
John Duncan, and James Cadenhead, for
example&mdash;and the racial element, as well as their
own individuality, distinguishes the work of Mr.
W. B. Macdougall and Mr. J. J. Guthrie of 'The
Elf.' Mr. Macdougall has been known as a book-illustrator
since 1896, when 'The Book of Ruth,'
with decorated borders showing the fertility of his
designing power, and illustrations that were no less
representative of a unique use of material, appeared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
The conventionalized landscape backgrounds, the
long, straightly-draped women, seemed strange
enough as a reading of the Hebrew pastoral, with
its close kinship to the natural life of the free
children of earth. Their unimpassioned faces, unspontaneous
gestures, the artificiality of the whole
impression, were undoubtedly a new reading of the
ancient charm of the story. Two books in 1897,
and 'Isabella' and 'The Shadow of Love,' 1898,
showed beyond doubt that the manner was not
assumed, that it was the expression of Mr. Macdougall's
sense of beauty. The decorations to
'Isabella' are more elaborate than to 'Ruth,' and
inventive handling of natural forms is as marked.
Again, the faces are de-characterized in accordance
with the desire to make the whole figure the
symbol of passion, and that without emphasis.
Mr. J. J. Guthrie is hardly among book-illustrators,
since 'Wedding Bells' of 1895 does not represent
Mr. Guthrie, nor does the child's book of the
following year, while the illustrations to Edgar
Allan Poe's 'Poems' are still, I think, being issued
from the Pear Tree Press in single numbers. His
treatment of landscape is inventive, his rhythmic
arrangements, his effects of white line on black,
are based on a real sense of the beauty of earth, of
tall trees and wooded hills, of mysterious moon-brightness
and shade in the leafy depths of the
woodlands.</p>

<p>Mr. Granville Fell made his name known in
1896 by his illustrations to 'The Book of Job.'
In careful detail, drawn with fidelity, never obtrusive,
his art is pre-Raphaelite. He touches<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
Japanese ideals in the rendering of flower-growth
and animals, but the whole effect of his decorative
illustrations is far enough away from the art of
Japan. In the 'Book of Job' he had a subject
sufficient to dwarf a very vital imaginative sense
by its grandeur. In the opinion of competent
critics Mr. Granville Fell proved more than the
technical distinction of his work by the manner in
which he fulfilled his purpose. The solid black
and white, the definite line of these drawings, were
laid aside for the sympathetic medium of pencil in
'The Song of Solomon' (1897). Again, his conception
is invariably dramatic, and never crudely
dramatic, robust, with no trace of morbid or sentimental
thought about it. The garden, the wealth
of vineyard and of royal pleasure ground, is used as
a background to comely and gracious figures. His
other work, illustrative of children's books and of
legend, the cover and title-page to Mr. W. B.
Yeats's 'Poems,' shows the same definite yet restrained
imagination.</p>

<p>Mr. Patten Wilson is somewhat akin to Mr.
Granville Fell in the energy and soundness of his
conceptions. Each of these artists is, as we know,
a colourist, delighting in brilliant and iridescent
colour-schemes, yet in black and white they do not
seek to suggest colour. Mr. Patten Wilson's illustrations
to Coleridge's 'Poems' have the careful
fulness of drawings well thought out, and worked
upon with the whole idea realised in the imagination.
He has observed life carefully for the purposes
of his art. But it is rather in rendering the
circumstance of poems, such as 'The Ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
Mariner,' or, in a Chaucer illustration&mdash;Constance
on the lonely ship&mdash;that he shows his grasp of
the subject, than by any expression of the spiritual
terror or loneliness of the one living man among
the dead, the solitary woman on strange seas.</p>

<p>Few decorative artists habitually use 'wash'
rather than line. Among these, however, is Mr.
Weguelin, who has illustrated Anacreon in a
manner to earn the appreciation of Greek scholars,
and his illustrations to Hans Andersen have had a
wider and not less appreciative reception. His
drawings have movement and atmosphere. Mr.
W. E. F. Britten also uses this medium with
fluency, as is shown by his successful illustrations
to Mr. Swinburne's 'Carols of the Year' in the
'Magazine of Art' in 1892-3. Since that time
his version of 'Undine,' and illustrations to Tennyson's
'Early Poems,' have shown the same power of
graceful composition and sympathy with his subject.</p>

<h2><a name="II_SOME_OPEN-AIR_ILLUSTRATORS" id="II_SOME_OPEN-AIR_ILLUSTRATORS"></a>II. SOME OPEN-AIR ILLUSTRATORS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap061o"><span class="dropcap">O</span></span>PEN-AIR illustration is less influenced
by the tradition of Rossetti
and of the romanticists of 'the sixties'
than any other branch of illustrative
art. The reason is obvious. Of all
illustrators, the illustrator of open-air
books has least concern with the interpretation
of literature, and is most concerned with recording
facts from observation. It is true that usually he
follows where a writer goes, and studies garden,
village or city, according to another man's inclination.
But the road they take, the cities and wayside
places, are as obvious to the one as to the
other. The artist has not to realize the personal
significance of beauty conceived by another mind;
he has to set down in black and white the aspect
of indisputable cities and palaces and churches, of
the actual highways and gardens of earth. No
fugitive light, but the light of common day shows
him his subject. So, although Stevenson's words,
that reaching romantic art one becomes conscious
of the background, are completely true in application
to the drawings of Rossetti, of Millais, Sandys
and Houghton, these 'backgrounds' have had no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
traceable effect on modern open-air illustration.
Nor are the landscape drawings in works such as
'Wayside Poesies,' or 'Pictures of English Landscape,'
at the beginning of the style or styles&mdash;formal
or picturesque&mdash;most in vogue at present.
Birket Foster has no followers; the pensive landscape
is not suited to holiday excursion books;
and, though Mr. J. W. North is among artists of
to-day, as a book-illustrator he has unfortunately
added little to his fine record of landscape drawings
made between 1864 and 1867. One cannot include
his work in a study of contemporary illustration,
though it is a pleasure passed over to leave
unconsidered drawings that in 'colour,' in effects
of winter-weather, of leaf-thrown light and shade
amid summer woods and over the green lanes of
English country, are delightfully remote from
obvious and paragraphic habits of rendering facts.</p>

<p>With few exceptions the open-air illustrators
of to-day began their work and took their place
in public favour, and in the estimation of critics,
after 1890. Mr. Joseph Pennell, it is true, had
been making sketches in England, in France,
and in Italy for some years; Mr. Railton had
made some preliminary illustrations; Mr. Alfred
Parsons illustrated 'Old Songs' with Mr. Abbey
in 1889; and Mr. Fulleylove contributed to 'The
Picturesque Mediterranean,' and published his
'Oxford' drawings, in the same year. Still,
with a little elasticity, 'the nineties' covers the
past activity of these men. The only important
exception is Sir George Reid, President of the
Royal Scottish Academy, much of whose illustrative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
work belongs to the years prior to 1890. The
one subject for regret in connection with Sir George
Reid's landscape illustrations is that the chapter is
closed. He makes no more drawings with pen-and-ink,
and the more one is content with those he has
made, the less does the quantity seem sufficient.
Those who know only the portraits on which Sir
George Reid's reputation is firmly based will find
in his landscape illustrations a new side to his art.
Here, as in portraiture, he sees distinctly and records
without prejudice the characteristics of his
subject. He renders what he sees, and he knows
how to see. His conception being clear to himself,
he avoids vagueness and obscurity, finding,
with apparent ease, plain modes of expression. A
straight observer of men and of the country-side,
there is this directness and perspicuity about his
work, whether he paints a portrait, or makes pen-drawings
of the village worthies of 'Pyketillim'
parish, or draws Pyketillim Kirk, small and white
and plain, with the sparse trees beside it, or great
river or city of his native land.</p>

<p>But in these pen-stroke landscapes, while the
same clear-headed survey, the same logical record
of facts, is to be observed as in his work as
a portrait painter, there is besides a charm of
manner that brings the indefinable element into
one's appreciation of excellent work. Of course
this is not to estimate these drawings above the portraits
of Sir George Reid. That would be absurd.
But he draws a country known to him all his life,
and unconsciously, from intimate memory, he suggests
more than actual observation would discover.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
This identification of past knowledge with the
special scrutiny of a subject to be rendered is not
usually possible in portraiture. The 'portrait in-time'
is a question of occasion as well as of genius.</p>

<p>The first book in which his inimitable pen-drawing
of landscape can be properly studied is
the illustrated edition of 'Johnny Gibb of Gushetneuk,
in the Parish of Pyketillim,' published in
1880. Here the illustrations are facsimile reproductions
by Amand-Durand's heliogravure process,
and their delicacy is perfectly seen. These drawings
are of the Aberdeenshire country-folk and
country, the native land of the artist; though, as a
lad in Aberdeen, practising lithography by day, and
seizing opportunities for independent art when
work was over, the affairs and doings of Gushetneuk,
of Smiddyward, of Pyketillim, or the quiet
of Benachie when the snow lies untrodden on its
slopes, were things outside the city of work.</p>

<p>It is as difficult to praise these drawings intelligibly
to those who have not seen them, as it is
unnecessary to enforce their charm on those who
have. Unfortunately, a reproduction of one of
them is not possible, and admirable as is the drawing
from 'Royal Edinburgh,' it is in subject and
in treatment distinct from the 'Gushetneuk' and
'North of Scotland' illustrations. The 'Twelve
Sketches of Scenery and Antiquities on the Great
North of Scotland Railway,' issued in 1883, were
made in 1881, and have the same characteristics as
the 'Gushetneuk' landscapes. The original drawings
for the engraved illustrations in 'The Life of
a Scotch Naturalist,' belonging to 1876&mdash;drawings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
made because the artist was 'greatly interested' in
the story of Thomas Edward&mdash;must have been of
the same delicate force, and the splendid volumes
of plates illustrating the 'River Clyde,' and the
'River Tweed,' issued by the Royal Association
for the Promotion of the Fine Arts in Scotland,
contain more of his fine work. It was this society,
that, in the difficult days following the artist's
abandonment of Aberdeen and lithography for
Edinburgh and painting, gave him the opportunity,
by the purchase of two of his early landscapes, for
study in Holland and in Paris. There is something
of Bosboom in a rendering of a church interior
such as 'The West Kirk,' but of Israels, who
was his master at the Hague, there is nothing to be
seen in Sir George Reid's illustrations. They are
never merely picturesque, and when too many men
are 'freakish' in their rendering of architecture,
the drawings of North of Scotland castles&mdash;well
founded to endure weather and rough times of war&mdash;seem
as real and true to Scottish romance as the
"pleasant seat," the martlet-haunted masonry of
Macbeth's castle set among the brooding wildness of
Inverness by the fine words of Duncan and Banquo.</p>

<p>The print-black of naked boughs against pale
sky, a snow-covered country where roofs are white,
and the shelter of the woods is thin after the
passing of the autumn winds&mdash;this black and white
is the black and white of most of Sir George Reid's
studies of northern landscape. To call it black and
white is to stretch the octave and omit all the
notes of the scale. Pure white of plastered masonry,
or of snow-covered roof or field in the bleak winter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
light, pure black in some deep-set window, in
the figure of a passer-by, or in the bare trees, are
used with the finesse of a colourist. Look at the
'Pyketillim Kirk' drawing in 'Johnny Gibb.'
Between the white of the long church wall, and
the black of the little groups of village folk in the
churchyard, how quiet and easy is the transition,
and how true to colour is the result. Of the
Edinburgh drawings the same may be said; but,
except in facsimile reproduction, one has to know
the scale of tone used by Sir George Reid in order
to see the original effect where the printed page
shows unmodified black and white. In 'Holyrood
Castle' the values are fairly well kept, and the
rendering of the ancient building in the deep
snow, without false emphasis, yet losing nothing of
emphatic effect, shows the dominant intellectual
quality of the artist's work.</p>

<p>It does not seem as though Sir George Reid as
an illustrator had any followers. He could hardly
have imitators. If a man had delicacy and patience
of observation and hand to produce drawings in this
'style,' his style would be his own and not an
imitation. The number of artists in black and
white who cannot plausibly be imitated is a small
number. Sir George Reid is one, Mr. Alfred
Parsons is another. Inevitably there are points of
similarity in the work of artists, the foundation of
whose black and white is colour, and who render
the country-side with the understanding of the
native, the understanding that is beyond knowledge.
The difference between them only proves
the essential similarity in the elements of their art;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
but that, like most paradoxes, is a truism. Mr.
Parsons is, of course, thoroughly English in his
art. He has the particularity of English nature-poets.
Pastoral country is dear to him, and homesteads
and flowering orchards, or villages with
church tower half hidden by the elms, are part of
his home country, the country he draws best. It
is interesting to compare his drawings for 'The
Warwickshire Avon' with the Scottish artist's
drawings of the northern rivers. The drawings
of Shakespeare's river show spring trees in a mist
of green, leafy summer trees, meadowsweet and
hayfields, green earth and blue sky, and a river of
pleasure watering a pleasant country. If a man can
draw English summer-time in colour with black
and white, he must rank high as a landscape pen-draughtsman.
Mr. Alfred Parsons has illustrated
about a dozen books, and his work is to be found
in 'Harper's Magazine,' and 'The English Illustrated'
in early days. Two books, the 'Old
Songs' and 'The Quiet Life,' published in 1887
and 1890, were illustrated by E. A. Abbey and
Alfred Parsons. The drawings of landscape, of
fruit and flowers, by Mr. Parsons, the Chippendale
people and rooms of Mr. Abbey, fill two charming
volumes with pictures whose pleasantness and happy
art accord with the dainty verses of eighteenth-century
sentiment. 'The Warwickshire Avon,'
and another river book, 'The Danube from the
Black Forest to the Sea,' illustrated in collaboration
with the author, Mr. F. D. Millet, belong to
1892. The slight sketches&mdash;passing-by sketches&mdash;in
these books, are among fortunate examples of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
briefness that few men find compatible with grace
and significance. Sketches, mostly in wash, of a
farther and more decorated country&mdash;'Japan, the
Far East, the Land of Flowers and of the Rising
Sun, the country which for years it had been my
dream to see and paint'&mdash;illustrate the artist's
'Notes in Japan,' 1895. In the written notes are
memoranda of actual colour, of the green harmony
of the Japanese summer&mdash;harmony culminating in
the vivid tint of the rice fields&mdash;of sunset and
butterflies, of delicate masses of azalea and drifts of
cherry-blossom and wisteria, while in the drawings
are all the flowers, the green hills and gray hamlets,
and the temples, shrines and bridges, that make
unspoilt Japan one of the perpetual motives of
decorative art. Illustrations to Wordsworth&mdash;to a
selected Wordsworth&mdash;gave the artist fortunate opportunities
to render the England of English descriptive
verse.</p>

<p>It is convenient to speak first of these painter-illustrators,
because, in a sense, they stand alone
among illustrative artists. Obviously, that is not to
say that their work is worth more than the work of
illustrators, who, conforming to the laws of 'process,'
make their drawings with brain and hand
that know how to win profit by concession. But
popularisers of an effective topographical or architectural
style are indirectly responsible for a large
amount of work besides their own. In one sense
a leader does not stand alone, and cannot be considered
alone. Before, then, passing on to a draughtsman
such as Mr. Joseph Pennell, again, to Mr.
Railton, or to Mr. New, whose successful and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
unforgettable works have inspired many drawings in
the books whereby authors pay for their holiday
journeys, other artists, whose style is no convenience
to the industrious imitator, may be considered.
Another painter, known for his work in black and
white, is Mr. John Fulleylove, whose 'Pictures of
Classic Greek Landscape,' and drawings of 'Oxford,'
show him to be one of the few men who see
architecture steadily and whole, and who draw
beautiful buildings as part of the earth which they
help to beautify. Compare the Greek drawings
with ordinary archæological renderings of pillared
temples, and the difference in beauty and interest
is apparent. In Mr. Fulleylove's drawings, the
relation between landscape and architecture is
never forgotten, and he draws both with the structural
knowledge of a landscape painter, who is also
by training an architect. In aim, his work is in
accord with classical traditions; he discerns the
classical spirit that built temples and carved statues
in the beautiful places of the open-air, a spirit
which has nothing of the museum setting about it.
The 'Oxford' drawings show that Mr. Fulleylove
can draw Gothic.</p>

<p>Though not a painter, Mr. William Hyde works
'to colour' in his illustrations, and is generally
successful in rendering both colour and atmosphere.
He has done little with the pen, and it is in wash
drawings, reproduced by photogravure, that he is
best to be studied. Of his early training as an engraver
there is little to be seen in his work, though
his appreciation of the range of tone existing between
black and white may have developed from working
within restrictions of monotone, when the colour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
sense was growing strong in him. At all events
he can gradate from black to white with remarkable
minuteness and ease. His earliest work of any importance
after giving up engraving, was in illustration
of 'L'Allegro' and 'Il Penseroso,' 1895, and
shows his talent already well controlled. There
are thirteen illustrations, and the opportunities for
rendering aspects of light, from the moment of the
lark's morning flight against the dappled skies of
dawn, to the passing of whispering night-winds over
the darkened country, given in the verse of a poet
sensitive as none before him to the gradations of
lightness and dark, are realized. So are the hawthorns
in the dale, and the towered cities. But it
is as an illustrator of another towered city than that
imagined by Milton, that some of Mr. Hyde's most
individual work has been produced. In the etchings
and pictures in photogravure published with
Mrs. Meynell's 'London Impressions,' London
beneath the strange great sky that smoke and
weather make over the gray roofs, London when
the dawn is low in the sky, or when the glow of
lamps and lamp-lit windows turns the street darkness
to golden haze, is drawn by a man who has
seen for himself how beautiful the great city is in
'between lights.' His other work is superficially
in contrast with these studies of city light and
darkness; but the same love for 'big' skies, for
the larger aspects of changing lights and cloud
movements, are expressed in the drawings of the
wide country that is around and beyond the Cinque
Ports, and in the illustrations to Mr. George
Meredith's 'Nature Poems.' The reproduction is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
from a pen drawing in Mr. Hueffer's book, 'The
Cinque Ports.' There is no pettiness about it, and
the 'phrasing' of castle, trees and sky shows the
artist.</p>

<p>Mr. D. Y. Cameron has illustrated a book or
two with etchings&mdash;notably White's 'Selborne'
1902,&mdash;but to consider him as a book-illustrator
would be to stretch a point. A few of his etchings
are to be seen in books, and one would like to make
them the text for the consideration of other etchings
by him, but it would be a digression. He is not
among painter-illustrators, but among painters who
have illustrated, and that would bring more names
into this chapter than it could hold except in
catalogue arrangement.</p>

<p>Coming to artists who are illustrators, not on
occasion but always, there is no question with
whom to begin. It is true that Mr. Pennell is
American, but he is such an important figure in
English illustration that to leave him out would be
impossible. He has been illustrating Europe for
more than fifteen years, and the forcible fashion of
his work, and all that he represents, have influenced
black-and-white artists in this country, as his master
Rico influenced him. In range and facility, and in
getting to the point and keeping there, there is no
open-air illustrator to put beside Mr. Pennell.
Always interested and always interesting, he is
apparently never bewildered, always ready and able
to draw. Surely there was never a mind with a
greater faculty for quick study; and he can apply
this power to the realization of an architectural
detail, or of a cathedral, of miles of country with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
river curves and castles, trees, and hills and fields,
and a stretch of sky over all; or of a great city-street
crowded with traffic, of new or old buildings,
of Tuscany or of the Stock Exchange, with equal
ease. To attempt a record of Mr. Pennell's work
would leave no room for appreciation of it. As
far as the English public is concerned, it began in
1885 with the publication of 'A Canterbury Pilgrimage,'
and since then each year has added to
Mr. Pennell's notes of the world at the rate of two
or three volumes. The highways and byways of
England&mdash;east, west, south and north&mdash;France
from Normandy to Provence, the cities and spaces
of Italy, the Saone and the Thames, the 'real'
Alps and the New Zealand Alps, London and
Paris, the Cathedrals of Europe, the gipsy encampment
and the Ghetto, Chelsea and the Alhambra&mdash;Mr. Pennell
has been everywhere and seen most
things as he went, and one can see it in his
drawings.</p>

<p>He draws architecture without missing anything
tangible, and his buildings belong to cities that
have life&mdash;and an individual life&mdash;in their streets.
But where he is unapproachable, or at all events
unapproached among pen-draughtsmen, is in drawing
a great scheme of country from a height. If
one could reproduce a drawing such as that of the
country of Le Puy in Mr. Wickham Flower's
'Aquitaine,' or, better still, the etching of the same
amazing country, one need say no more about Mr.
Pennell's art in this kind. Unluckily the page is
too small. This strange and lovely landscape,
where curving road and river and tree-bordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
fields are dominated by two image-crowned rocks,
built about with close-set houses, looks like a design
from a dream fantasy worked out by a master
of definite imagination. One knows it is not.
Mr. Pennell is concerned to give facts in picturesque
order, and here he has a theme that affects us
poetically, however it may have affected Mr. Pennell.
His eye measures a landscape that seems outside
the measure of observation, and his ability to grasp
and render the characteristics of actuality serves him
as ever. It is an unforgettable drawing, though
the skill displayed in the simplification and relation
of facts is no greater than in other drawings by the
artist. That power hardly ever fails him. The
'Devils of Notre Dame' again stands out in memory,
when one thinks generally of Mr. Pennell's drawings.
And again, though it seems as if he were
working above his usual pitch of conception, it is
only that he is using his keenness of sight, his
logical grasp of form and power of expression, on
matter that is expressive of mental passion. The
man who carved the devils, like those who crowned
the rocks of Le Puy with the haloed figures, created
facts. The outrageous passion that made these evil
things made them in stone. You can measure
them. They are matter-of-fact. Mr. Pennell has
drawn them as they are, with so much trenchancy,
such assertion of their hideous decorativeness,
their isolation over modern Paris, that no drawings
could be better, and any others would be superfluous.
It is impossible to enumerate all that Mr. Pennell
has done and can do in black-and-white. He is a
master of so many methods. From the sheer black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
ink and white paper of the 'Devils,' to the light
broken line that suggests Moorish fantastic architecture
under a hot sun in the 'Alhambra' drawings,
there is nothing he cannot do with a pen. Nor is
it only with a pen that he can do what he likes and
what we must admire. He covers the whole field
of black-and-white drawing.</p>

<p>After Mr. Pennell comes Mr. Herbert Railton.
No architectural drawings are more popular than
his, and no style is better known or more generally
'adopted' by the illustrators of little guide-books
or of magazine articles. An architect's training and
knowledge of structure underlies the picturesque
dilapidation prevalent in his version of Anglo-gothic
architecture. His first traceable book-illustrations
belong to 1888, though in 'The English
Illustrated,' in 'The Portfolio,' and elsewhere, he
had begun before then to formulate the style that
has served him so admirably in later work with
the pen. The illustrations to Mr. Loftie's 'Westminster
Abbey' (1890) show his manner much as
it is in his latest pen drawings. There is a lack of
repose. One would like to undecorate some of the
masonry, to reveal the austere lines under the prevalence
of pattern. At the same time one realizes
that here is the style needed in illustration of picturesquely
written books about picturesque places,
and that the stone tracery of Westminster, or the
old brick and tiles of the Inns of Court, are more
interesting to many people in drawings such as
these than in actuality. But Rico's 'broken line'
is responsible for much, and not every draughtsman
who adopts it direct, or through a mixed tradition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
has the architectural knowledge of Mr. Railton to
support his deviations from stability. Mr. Railton
is the artist of the Cathedral Guide; he has drawn
Westminster, St. Paul's, Winchester, Gloucester,
Peterborough, and many more cathedrals, inside and
out, within the last ten years. In illustrations to
books where a thread of story runs through historical
fact, books such as those written by Miss
Manning concerning Mary Powell, and the household
of Sir Thomas More, the artist has collaborated
with Mr. Jellicoe, who has put figures in the streets
and country lanes.</p>

<p>There are so many names in the list of those
who, in the beginning, profited by the initiative
of Mr. Pennell or of Mr. Railton that generally
they may be set aside. Of artists who have made
some position for themselves, there are enough to
fill this chapter. Mr. Holland Tringham and
Mr. Hedley Fitton were at one time unmistakable
in their Railtonism. Mr. Fitton has illustrated
cathedral books, and in later drawings by Mr.
Tringham exaggeration of his copy has given place
to a more direct record of beautiful buildings.
Miss Nelly Erichsen and Miss Helen James<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> are
two artists whose work is much in request for
illustrated series, such as Dent's 'Mediæval Towns.'
Miss James' drawings to 'Rambles in Dickens'
Land' (1899) showed study of Mr. Railton, which
is also observable in other books, such as 'The
Story of Rouen.' At the same time, she carries
out her work from individual observation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
gets an effect that belongs to study of the subject,
whether from actuality or from photographs. Miss
James and Miss Erichsen have collaborated in
certain books on Italian towns, but architectural
drawing is only part of Miss Erichsen's illustrative
work, though an important part, as the illustrations
to the recently-published 'Florentine Villas' of
Mrs. Ross show. Illustrating stories, she works
with graceful distinctness, and many of the drawings
in the 'Story of Rome'&mdash;though one remembers
that Rome is in Mr. Pennell's province&mdash;show
what she can do.</p>

<p>Mr. C. G. Harper and Mr. C. R. B. Barrett are
the most prominent among those writers of travel-books
who are also their own illustrators. They
belong, though with all the difference of time and
development, to the succession of Mr. Augustus
Hare. Mr. Hissey also has made many books out
of his driving tours through England, and may
be said to have first specialized the subject that
Mr. Harper and Mr. Barrett have made their own.
It is plain that the kind of book has nothing to do
with the kind of art that is used in its making.
Mr. Hare's famous 'Walks' may be the prototypes
of later books, but each man makes what he can
out of an idea that has obvious possibilities in it.
Mr. Harper has taken to the ancient high-roads
of England, and has studied their historical and
legendary, past, present, and imagined aspects. Of
these he has written; while his illustrations rank
him rather among illustrators who write than
among writers who illustrate. Since 1889 he has
published a dozen books and more. In 'Royal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Winchester'&mdash;the first of these&mdash;he is illustrator
only. 'The Brighton Road' of 1892 is the first
of the road-books, and the illustrations of the road
as it was and is, of town and of country, have
colour and open air in their black-and-white.
Since then Mr. Harper has been from Paddington
to Penzance, has followed Dick Turpin along the
Exeter road, and bygone fashion from London to
Bath, while accounts of the Dover road from
Southwark Bridge to Dover Castle, by way of
Dickens' country and hop-gardens, and of the
Great North Road of which Stevenson longed to
write, are written and drawn with spirited observation.
His drawing is not so picturesque as his
writing. It has reticence and justness of expression
that would not serve in relating tales of the road, but
which, together with a sense of colour and of what is
pictorial, combine to form an effective and frequently
distinctive style of illustration. The drawing
reproduced, chosen by the artist, is from Mr.
Harper's recent book on the Holyhead road.</p>

<p>Mr. Barrett has described and illustrated the
'highways and byways and waterways' of various
English counties, as well as published a volume on
the battlefields of England, and studies of ancient
buildings such as the Tower of London. He is
always well informed, and illustrates his subject
fully from pen-and-ink drawings. Mr. F. G.
Kitton also writes and illustrates, though he has
written more than he has drawn. St. Albans is
his special town, and the old inns and quaint
streets of the little red city with its long cathedral,
are truthfully and dexterously given in his pen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
drawings and etchings. Mr. Alexander Ansted,
too, as a draughtsman of English cathedrals and of
city churches, has made a steady reputation since
1894, when his etchings and drawings of Riviera
scenery showed ambition to render tone, and as
much as possible of colour and atmosphere, with
pen and ink. Since then he has simplified his style
for general purposes, though in books such as 'London
Riverside Churches' (1897), or 'The Romance
of our Ancient Churches' of two years later, many
of the drawings are more elaborate than is common
in modern illustration. The names of Mr. C. E.
Mallows and of Mr. Raffles Davison must be mentioned
among architectural draughtsmen, though
they are outside the scope of a study of book-illustration.
Some of Mr. Raffles Davison's work has
been reprinted from the 'British Architect,' but I
do not think either of them illustrates books. An
extension of architectural art lies in the consideration
of the garden in relation to the house it surrounds,
and Mr. Reginald Blomfield's 'Formal
Garden' treats of the first principles of garden design
as distinct from horticulture. The drawings
by Mr. Inigo Thomas, whether one considers them
as illustrating principles or gardens, are worth
looking at, as 'The Yew Walk' sufficiently shows.</p>

<p>The sobriety and decorum of Mr. New's architectural
and landscape drawings are the antithesis of
the flagrantly picturesque. I do not know whether
Mr. Gere or Mr. New invented this order of landscape
and house drawing, but Mr. New is the chief
exponent of it, and has placed it among popular
styles of to-day. It has the effect of sincerity, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
of respectful treatment of ancient buildings. Mr.
New does not lapse from the perpendicular, his
hand does not tremble or break off when house-walls
or the ridge of a roof are to be drawn. His
is a convention that is frankly conventional, that
confines nature within decorous bounds, and makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
formality a function of art. But though a great
deal of Mr. New's work is mechanical and done to
pattern, so that sometimes little perpendicular
strokes to represent grass fill half the pictured
space, while little horizontal strokes to represent
brick-work, together with 'touches' that represent
foliage, fill up the rest except for a corner left
blank for the sky; yet, at his best, he achieves an
effective and dignified way of treating landscape
for the decoration of books. Sensational skies that
repeat one sensation to monotony, scattered blacks
and emphasized trivialities, are set aside by those
who follow Mr. New. When they are trivial and
undiscriminating, they are unaffectedly tedious, and
that is almost pleasant after the hackneyed sparkle
of the inferior picturesque.</p>

<p>Mr. New's reputation as a book-illustrator was
first made in 1896, when an edition of 'The Compleat
Angler' with many drawings by him appeared.
The homely architecture of Essex villages
and small towns, the low meadows and quiet
streams, gave him opportunity for drawings that
are pleasant on the page. Two garden books, or
strictly speaking, one&mdash;for 'In the Garden of
Peace' was succeeded by 'Outside the Garden'&mdash;contain
natural history drawings similar to those
of fish in 'The Compleat Angler' and of birds in
White's 'Selborne.' The illustrations to 'Oxford
and its Colleges,' and 'Cambridge and its Colleges,'
are less representative of the best Mr. New can do
than books where village architecture, or the
irregular house-frontage of country high-streets
are his subject. Illustrating Shakespeare's country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
'Sussex,' and 'The Wessex of Thomas Hardy,'
brought him into regions of the country-town;
but the most important of his recent drawings are
those in 'The Natural History of Selborne,' published
in 1900. The drawing of 'Selborne Street'
is from that volume.</p>

<p>With Mr. New, Mr. R. J. Williams and Mr.
H. P. Clifford illustrated Mr. Aymer Vallance's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
two books on William Morris. Their illustrations
are fit records of the homes and working-places of
the great man who approved their art. Mr.
Frederick Griggs, who since 1900 has illustrated
three or four garden books, also follows the principles
of Mr. New, but with more variety in
detail, less formality in tree-drawing and in the
rendering of paths and roads and streams and sunshine,
in short, with more of art outside the school,
than Mr. New permits himself.</p>

<p>The open-air covers so much that I have little
room to give to another aspect of open-air illustration&mdash;drawings
of bird and animal-life. The work
of Mr. Harrison Weir, begun so many years ago,
is chiefly in children's books; but Mr. Charles
Whymper, who has an old reputation among
modern reputations, has illustrated the birds and
beasts and fish of Great Britain in books well
known to sportsmen and to natural historians, as
also books of travel and sport in tropical and ice-bound
lands. The work of Mr. John Guille
Millais is no less well known. No one else draws
animals in action, whether British deer or African
wild beast, from more intelligent and thorough
observation, and of his art the graceful rendering
of the play of deer in Cawdor Forest gives proof
that does not need words. Birds in flight, beasts
in action&mdash;Mr. Millais is undisputably master of
his subject. Many drawings show the humour
which is one of the charms of his work.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="dropcap091s"><span class="dropcap">S</span></span>O far, in writing of decorative illustrators
and of open-air illustrators,
the difference in scheme between a
study of book-illustration and of
'black-and-white' art has not greatly
affected the scale and order of facts.
The intellectual idea of illustration, as a personal
interpretation of the spirit of the text, finds expression,
formally at least, in the drawings of most
decorative black-and-white artists. The deliberate
and inventive character of their art, the fact
that such qualities are non-journalistic, and ineffective
in the treatment of 'day by day' matters,
keeps the interpretative ideal, brought into English
illustration by Rossetti, and the artists whose
spirits he kindled, among working ideals for these
illustrators. For that reason, with the exception
of page-decorations such as those of Mr. Edgar
Wilson, the subject of decorative illustration is
almost co-extensive with the subject of decorative
black-and-white. The open-air illustrator represents
another aspect of illustration. To interpret
the spirit of the text would, frequently, allow his
art no exercise. Much of his text is itinerary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
His subject is before his eyes in actuality, or in
photographs, and not in some phrase of words,
magical with suggested forms, creating by its gift
of delight desire to celebrate its beauty. Still,
if the artist be independent of the intellectual and
imaginative qualities of the book, his is no independent
form of black and white. It is illustration;
the author's subject is the subject of the
artist. Open-air facts, those that are beautiful and
pleasurable, are too uneventful to make 'news
illustration.' Unless as background for some event,
they have, for most people, no immediate interest.
So it happens that open-air drawings are usually
illustrations of text, text of a practical guide-book
character, or of archæological interest, or of the
gossiping, intimate kind that tells of possessions,
of journeys and pleasurings, or, again, illustrations
of the open-air classics in prose and verse.</p>

<p>But in turning to the work of those draughtsmen
whose subject is the presentment of character,
of every man in his own humour, the illustration
of literature is a part only of what is noteworthy.
These artists have a subject that makes the opportunities
of the book-illustrator seem formal; a
subject, charming, poignant, splendid or atrocious,
containing all the 'situations' of comedy, tragedy
or farce; the only subject at once realized by everyone,
yet whose opportunities none has ever comprehended.
The writings of novelists and dramatists&mdash;life
narrowed to the perception of an individual&mdash;are
limitary notions of the matter, compared with
the illimitable variety of character and incident to
be found in the world that changes from day to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
day. And 'real' life, purged of monotony by the
wit, discrimination or extravagance of the artist,
or&mdash;on a lower plane&mdash;by the combination only
of approved comical or sentimental or melodramatic
elements, is the most popular and marketable of
all subjects. The completeness of a work of art is
to some a refuge from the incompleteness of
actuality; to others this completeness is more incomplete
than any incident of their own experience.
The first bent of mind&mdash;supposing an artist who
illustrates to 'express himself'&mdash;makes an illustrator
of a draughtsman, the second makes literature seem
no more than <i>la reste</i> to the artist as an opportunity
for pictorial characterization.</p>

<p>Character illustration is then a subject within a
subject, and if it be impossible to consider it without
overseeing the limitations, yet a different point
of view gives a different order of impressions.
Caricaturists, political cartoonists, news-illustrators
and graphic humorists, the artists who pictorialize
society, the stage, the slums or some other kind
of life interesting to the spectator, are outside
the scheme of this article&mdash;unless they be illustrators
also. For instance, the illustrations of Sir
Harry Furniss are only part of his lively activities,
and Mr. Bernard Partridge is the illustrator of
Mr. Austin Dobson's eighteenth-century muse as
well as the 'J. B. P.' of 'socials' in 'Punch.'</p>

<p>An illustrator of many books, and one whose
illustrations have unusual importance, both as interpretations
of literature and for their artistic force,
Mr. William Strang is yet so incongruous with contemporary
black-and-white artists of to-day that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
must be considered first and separately. For the
traditions of art and of race that find a focus in the
illustrative etchings of this artist, the creative traditions,
and instinctive modes of thought that are
represented in the forms and formation of his art,
are forces of intellect and passion and insight not
previously, nor now, by more than the one artist,
associated with the practice of illustration. To
consider his work in connection with modern
illustration is to speak of contrasts. It represents
nothing that the gift-book picture represents,
either in technical dexterities, founded on the requirements
of process reproduction, or in its decorative
ideals, or as expressive of the pleasures of
literature. One phase of Mr. Strang's illustrative
art is, indeed, distinct from the mass of his work,
with which the etched illustrations are congruous,
and the line-drawings to three masterpieces of
imaginary adventure&mdash;to Lucian, to Baron Munchausen
and to Sindbad&mdash;show, perhaps, some infusion
of Aubrey Beardsley's spirit of fantasy into
the convictions of which Mr. Strang's art is compounded.
But these drawings represent an excursion
from the serious purpose of the artist's
work. The element in literature expressed by
that epithet 'weird'&mdash;exiled from power to common
service&mdash;is lacking in the extravagances of these
<i>voyages imaginaires</i>, and, lacking the shadows cast
by the unspeakable, the intellectual <i>chiaroscuro</i> of
Mr. Strang's imagination, loses its force. These
travellers are too glib for the artist, though his
comprehension of the grotesque and extravagant,
and his humour, make the drawings expressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
of the text, if not of the complete personality of
the draughtsman. The 'types, shadows and metaphors'
of 'The Pilgrim's Progress,' with its poignancies
of mental experience and conflict, its transcendent
passages, its theological and naïve moods,
gave the artist an opportunity for more realized
imagination. The etchings in this volume, published
in 1894, represent little of the allegorical
actualities of the text. Not the encounters by the
way, the clash of blows, the 'romancing,' but the
'man cloathed with rags and a great Burden on his
back,' or Christiana his wife, when 'her thoughts
began to work in her mind,' are the realities to the
artist. The pilgrims are real and credible, poor
folk to the outward sight, worn with toil, limited,
abused in the circumstances of their lives; and
these peasant figures are to Mr. Strang, as to his
master in etching, Professor Legros, symbols of
endurance, significant protagonists in the drama of
man's will and the forces that strive to subdue its
strength. To both artists the peasant confronting
death is the climax of the drama. In the etchings
of Professor Legros death fells the woodman, death
meets the wayfarer on the high-road. There is no
outfacing the menace of death. But to Mr. Strang,
the sublimity of Bunyan's 'poor man,' who overcomes
all influences of mortality by the strength
of his faith, is a possible fact. His ballad illustrations
deal finely with various aspects of the theme.
In 'The Earth Fiend,' a ballad written and illustrated
with etchings by Mr. Strang in 1892, the
peasant subdues and compels to his service the
spirit of destruction. He maintains his projects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
of cultivation, conquers the adverse wildness of
nature, makes its force productive of prosperity
and order; then, on a midday of harvest, sleeps,
and the 'earth fiend,' finding his tyrant defenceless,
steals on him and kills him as he lies. 'Death
and the Ploughman's Wife' (1894) has a braver
ending. It interprets in an impressive series of
etchings how 'Death that conquers a'' is vanquished
by the mother whose child he has snatched
from its play. The title-page etching shows a
little naked child kicking a skull into the air,
while the peasant-mother, patient, vigilant, keeps
watch near by. In 'The Christ upon the Hill'
of the succeeding year, a ballad by Cosmo Monkhouse
with etchings by Mr. Strang, the artist
follows, of course, the conception of the writer;
but here, too, his work is expressive of the visionary
faith that discerns death as one of those 'base
things' that 'usher in things Divine.'</p>

<p>The twelve etchings to 'Paradise Lost' (1896)
do not, as I think, represent Mr. Strang's imagination
at its finest. It is in the representation of
rude forms of life, subjected to the immeasurable
influences of passion, love, sorrow, that the images
of Mr. Strang's art, at once vague and of intense
reality, primitive and complex, have most force.
Adam and Eve driven from Paradise by the angel
with the flaming sword, are not directly created
by the artist. They recall Masaccio, and are undone
by the recollection. Eve, uprising in the
darkness of the garden where Adam sleeps, the
speech of the serpent with the woman, the gathering
of the fruit, are traditionary in their pictorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
forms, and the tradition is too great, it imposes
itself between the version of Mr. Strang and our
admiration. But in the thirty etchings illustrative
of Mr. Kipling's works, as in the ballad etchings,
the imagination of the artist is unfettered by tradition.
The stories he pictures deal, for all their
cleverness and definition, with themes that, translated
out of Mr. Kipling's words into the large
imagination of Mr. Strang, have powerful purpose.
As usual, the artist makes his picture not of matter-of-fact&mdash;and
the etching called 'A Matter of Fact'
is specially remote from any such matter&mdash;but of
more purposeful, more overpowering realities than
any particular instance of life would show. He
attempts to realize the value, not of an instance of
emotion or of endeavour, but of the quality itself.
He sets his mind, for example, to realize the
force of western militarism in the east, or the attitude
of the impulses of life towards contemplation,
and his soldiers, his 'Purun Bhagat,' express his
observations or imaginations of these themes. Certainly
'a country's love' never went out to this
kind of Tommy Atkins, and the India of Mr. Strang
is not the India that holds the Gadsbys, or of which
plain tales can be told. But he has imagined a
country that binds the contrasts of life together in
active operation on each other, and in thirty instances
of these schemed-out realities, or of dramatic
events resulting from the clash of racial and national
and chronological characteristics, he has achieved
perhaps his most complete expression of insight
into essentials. Mr. Strang's etchings in the recently
published edition of 'The Compleat Angler,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
illustrated by him and by Mr. D. Y. Cameron, are
less successful. The charm of his subject seems
not to have entered into his imagination, whereas
forms of art seem to have oppressed him. The
result is oppressive, and that is fatal to the value
of his etchings as illustrations of the book that 'it
would sweeten a man's temper at any time to read.'
Intensity and large statement of dark and light;
fine dramatizations of line; an unremitting conflict
with the superfluous and inexpressive in form and
in thought; an art based on the realities of life,
and without finalities of expression, inelegant, as
though grace were an affectation, an insincerity in
dealing with matters of moment: these are qualities
that detach the illustrations of Mr. Strang
from the generality of illustrations. Save that
Mr. Robert Bryden, in his 'Woodcuts of men of
letters' and in the portrait illustrations to 'Poets
of the younger generation,' shows traces of studying
the portrait-frontispieces of Mr. Strang, there
is no relation between his art and the traditions
it represents and any other book-illustrations of
to-day.</p>

<p>Turning now to illustrators who are representative
of the tendencies and characteristics of modern
book-illustration, and so are less conspicuous in a
general view of the subject than Mr. Strang, there
is little question with whom to begin. Mr. Abbey
represents at their best the qualities that belong to
gift-book illustration. It would, perhaps, be more
correct to say that gift-book illustration represents
the qualities of Mr. Abbey's black and white with
more or less fidelity, so effective is the example of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
his technique on the forms of picturesque character-illustration.
It is nearly a quarter of a century
since the artist, then a young man fresh from
Harper's drawing-office in New York, came to
England. That first visit, spent in studying the
reality of English pastoral life in preparation for
his 'Herrick' illustrations, lasted for two years,
and after a few months' interval in the States he
returned to England. Resident here for nearly
all the years of his work, a member of the Royal
Academy, his art expressive of traditions of English
literature and of the English country to which
he came as to the actuality of his imaginings, one
may include Mr. Abbey among English book-illustrators
with more than a show of reason.
In 1882, when the 'Selections from the Poetry of
Robert Herrick' was published, few of the men
whose work is considered in this chapter had been
heard of. Chronologically, Mr. Abbey is first of
contemporary character-illustrators, and nowhere
but first would he be in his proper place, for there
is no one to put beside him in his special fashion
of art, and in the effect of his illustrative work on
his contemporaries. There is inevitable ease and
elegance in the pen-drawings of Mr. Abbey, and
for that reason it is easy to underestimate their
intellectual quality. He is inventive. The spirit
of Herrick's muse, or of 'She Stoops to Conquer,'
or of the comedies of Shakespeare, is not a quality
for which he accepts any formula. He finds shapes
for his fancies, rejecting as alien to his purpose all
that is not the clear result of his own understanding
of the poet. Accordingly there is, in all his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
work, the expression of an intellectual conception.
He sees, too, with patience. If he isolates a figure,
one feels that figure has stepped forward into a
clear place of his imagination as he followed its
way through the crowd. If he sets a pageant on
the page, or some piece of turbulent action, or
moment of decision, the actors have their individual
value. He thinks his way through processes
of gradual realization to the final picture of
the characters in the play or poem. One writes
now with special reference to the illustrations of
the comedies of Shakespeare&mdash;so far, the illustrative
work most exigent to the intellectual powers
of the artist. Herrick's verse, full of sweet sounds
and suggestive of happy sights, 'She Stoops to
Conquer,' where all the mistakes are but for a
night, to be laughed over in the morning, the lilt
and measure of 'Old Songs,' and of the charming
verses in 'The Quiet Life,' called for sensitive
appreciation of moods, lyrical, whimsical, humorous,
idyllic, but&mdash;intellectually&mdash;for no more than
this. As to Mr. Abbey's technique, curious as he
is in the uses of antiquity as part of the pleasure of
a fresh realization, clothing his characters in textiles
of the great weaving times, or of a dainty
simplicity, a student of architecture and of landscape,
of household fittings, of armoury, of every
beautiful accessory to the business of living, his
clever pen rarely fails to render within the convention
of black and white the added point of
interest and of charm that these things bring into
actuality. Truth of texture, of atmosphere, and of
tone, an alertness of vision most daintily expressed&mdash;these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
qualities belong to all Mr. Abbey's work,
and in the Shakespearean drawings he shows with
greater force than ever his 'stage-managing'
power, and the correctness and beauty of his
'mounting.' The drawings are dramatic: the
women have beauty and individuality, while the
men match them, or contrast with them as in the
plays; the rogues are vagabonds in spirit, and the
wise men have weight; the world of Shakespeare
has been entered by the artist. But there are
gestures in the text, moments of glad grace, of
passion, of sudden amazement before the realities
of personal experience, that make these active,
dignified figures of Mr. Abbey 'merely players,'
his Isabella in the extremity of the scene with
Claudio no more than an image of cloistered
virtue, his Hermione incapable of her undaunted
eloquence and silence, his Perdita and Miranda
and Rosalind less than themselves.</p>

<p>As illustrations, the drawings of Mr. Abbey
represent traditions brought into English illustrative
art by the Pre-Raphaelites, and developed by
the freer school of the sixties. But, as drawings,
they represent ideas not effective before in the
practice of English pen-draughtsmen; ideas derived
from the study of the black and white of Spain, of
France, and of Munich, by American art students
in days when English illustrators were not given to
look abroad. Technically he has suggested many
things, especially to costume illustrators, and many
names might follow his in representation of the
place he fills in relation to contemporary art. But
to work out the effect of a man's technique on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
those who are gaining power of expression is to
labour in vain. It adds nothing to the intrinsic
value of an artist's work, nor does it represent the
true relationship between him and those whom he
has influenced. For if they are mere imitators they
have no relation with any form of art, while to
insist upon derived qualities in work that has the
superscription of individuality is no true way of
apprehension. What a man owes to himself is the
substantial fact, the fact that relates him to other
men. The value of his work, its existence, is in
the little more, or the much more, that himself
adds to the sum of his directed industries, his
guided achievements. And to estimate that, to
attempt to express something of it, must be the
chief aim of a study, not of one artist and his
'times,' but of many artists practising a popular
art.</p>

<p>So that if, in consideration of their 'starting-point,'
one may group most character-illustrators,
especially of wig-and-powder subjects, as adherents
either of Mr. Abbey and the 'American school,'
or of Mr. Hugh Thomson and the Caldecott-Greenaway
tradition, such grouping is also no more
than a starting-point, and everything concerning
the achievements of the individual artist has still
to be said.</p>

<p>Considering the intention of their technique, one
may permissibly group the names of Mr. Fred
Pegram, Mr. F. H. Townsend, Mr. Shepperson,
Mr. Sydney Paget, and Mr. Stephen Reid as
representing in different degrees the effect of
American black and white on English technique,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
though, in the case of Mr. Paget, one alludes only
to pen-drawings such as those in 'Old Mortality,'
and not to his Sherlock Holmes and Martin Hewitt
performances. The art of Mr. Pegram and of Mr.
Townsend is akin. Mr. Pegram has, perhaps,
more sense of beauty, and his work suggests a more
complete vision of his subject than is realized in
the drawings of Mr. Townsend, while Mr. Townsend
is at times more successful with the activities
of the story; but the differences between them
seem hardly more than the work of one hand would
show. They really collaborate in illustration,
though, except in Cassell's survey of 'Living London,'
they have never, I think, made drawings for
the same book.</p>

<p>Mr. Pegram served the usual apprenticeship to
book-illustration. He was a news-illustrator before
he turned to the illustration of literature; but he
is an artist to whom the reality acquired by a
subject after study of it is more attractive than the
reality of actual impressions. Neither sensational
nor society events appeal to him. The necessity
to compose some sort of an impression from the
bare facts of a fact, without time to make the best
of it, was not an inspiring necessity. That Mr.
Pegram is a book-illustrator by the inclination of
his art as well as by profession, the illustrations
to 'Sybil,' published in 1895, prove. In these
drawings he showed himself not only observant of
facial expression and of gesture, but also able to
interpret the glances and gestures of Disraeli's
society. From the completeness of the draughtsman's
realization of his subject, illustrable situations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
develop themselves with credibility, and his graceful
women and thoughtful men represent the events
of the novel with distinction. With 'Sybil' may
be mentioned the illustrations to 'Ormond,' wherein,
five years later, the same understanding of the ways
and activities of a bygone, yet not remote society,
found equally satisfactory expression, while the
technique of the artist had gained in completeness.
In 'The Last of the Barons' (1897), Mr. Pegram
had a picturesque subject with much strange
humanity in it, despite Lord Lytton's conventional
travesty of events and character. The names of
Richard and Warwick, of Hastings and Margaret
of Anjou, are names that break through conventional
romance, but the illustrator has to keep up
the fiction of the author, and, except that the
sham-mediævalism of the novel did not prevent a
right study of costumes and accessories in the
pictures, the artist had to be content to 'Bulwerize.'
Illustrations to 'The Arabian Nights' gave him
opportunity for rendering textures and atmosphere,
and movements charming or grave, and the
'Bride of Lammermoor' drawings show a sweet-faced
Lucy Ashton, and a Ravenswood who is
more than melancholy and picturesque. Mr.
Pegram's drawings are justly dramatic within the
limits prescribed by a somewhat composed ideal of
bearing. A catastrophe is outside these limits, and
the discovery of Lucy after the bridal lacks real
illustration in the artist's version, skilful, nevertheless,
as are all his drawings, and expressed without
hesitation. Averse to caricature, and keeping
within ideas of life that allow of unbroken expression,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
the novels of Marryat, where action so bustling
that only caricatures of humanity can endure
its exigencies, and sentimental episodes of flagrant
insincerity, swamp the character-drawing, are hardly
suited to the art of Mr. Pegram. Still, he selects,
and his selection is true to the time and circumstance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
of Marryat's work. In itself it is always an
expression of a coherent and definite conception of
the story.</p>

<p>Mr. Townsend has illustrated Hawthorne and
Peacock, as well as Charlotte Brontë and Scott.
Hawthorne's men and women&mdash;embodiments
always of some essential quality, rather than of the
combination of qualities that make 'character'&mdash;lend
themselves to fine illustration as regards
gesture, and Mr. Townsend's drawings represent,
not insensitively, the movement and suggestion of
'The Blithedale Romance' and 'The House of
the Seven Gables.' In the Peacock illustrations
the artist had to keep pace with an essentially un-English
humour, an imagination full of shapes
that are opinions and theories and sarcasms masquerading
under fantastic human semblances. Mr.
Townsend kept to humanity, and found occasions
for representing the eccentrics engaged in cheerful
open-air and society pursuits in the pauses of
paradoxical discussion. One realizes in the drawings
the pleasant aspect of life at Gryll Grange and
at Crotchet Castle, the courtesies and amusements
out of doors and within, while the subjects of
'Maid Marian,' of 'The Misfortunes of Elphin'
and of 'Rhododaphne' declare themselves in excellent
terms of romance and adventure. Mr.
Townsend has humour, and he is in sympathy
with the vigorous spirit in life; whether the vigour
is intellectual as in Jane Eyre and in Shirley
Keeldar, or muscular as in 'Rob Roy,' in drawings
to a manual of fencing, and in Marryat's 'The
King's Own,' or eccentric as in the fantasies of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Peacock. His work is never languid and never
formal; and if in technique he is sometimes experimental,
and frequently content with ineffectual
accessories to his figures, his conception of the
situation, and of the characters that fulfil the situation,
is direct and effective enough.</p>

<p>As an illustrator of current fiction, Mr. Townsend
has also a considerable amount of dexterous
work to his name, but a record of drawings contributed
to the illustrated journals cannot even be
attempted within present limits of space.</p>

<p>Mr. Shepperson in his book-illustrations generally
represents affairs with picturesqueness, and with
a nervous energy that takes the least mechanical
way of expressing forms and substances. Illustrating
the modern novel of adventure, he is happy
in his intrigues and conspiracies, while in books of
more weight, such as 'The Heart of Midlothian'
or 'Lavengro,' he expresses graver issues of life
with un-elaborate and suggestive effect. The
energy of his line, the dramatic quality of his
imagination, render him in his element as an
illustrator of events, but the vigour that projects
itself into subjects such as the murder of Sir George
Staunton, or the fight with the Flaming Tinman, or
the alarms and stratagems of Mr. Stanley Weyman,
informs also his representation of moments when
there is no action. Technically Mr. Shepperson represents
very little that is traditional in English black
and white, though the tradition seems likely to be
there for future generations of English illustrators.</p>

<p>In a recent work, illustrations to Leigh Hunt's
'Old Court Suburb,' Mr. Shepperson collaborates
with Mr. E. J. Sullivan and Mr. Herbert Railton,
to realize the associations, literary, historical and
gossiping, that have Kensington Palace and Holland
House as their principal centres. On the whole,
of the three artists, the subject seems least suggestive
to Mr. Shepperson. Mr. Sullivan contributes many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
portraits, and some subject drawings that show him
in his lightest and most dexterous vein. These
drawings of <i>beaux</i> and <i>belles</i> are as distinct in their
happy flattery of fact from the rigid assertion of the
artist's 'Fair Women,' as they are from the undelightful
reporting style that in the beginning
injured Mr. Sullivan's illustrations. One may
describe it as the 'Daily Graphic' style, though
that is to recognize only the basis of convenience
on which the training of the 'Daily Graphic'
school was necessarily founded. Mr. Sullivan's
early work, the news-illustration and illustrations to
current fiction of Mr. Reginald Cleaver and of his
brother Mr. Ralph Cleaver, the black and white
of Mr. A. S. Boyd and of Mr. Crowther, show this
journalistic training, and show, too, that such a
training in reporting facts directly is no hindrance
to the later achievement of an individual way of
art. Mr. A. S. Hartrick must also be mentioned
as an artist whose distinctive black and white
developed from the basis of pictorial reporting, and
how distinctive and well-observed that art is,
readers of the 'Pall Mall Magazine' know. As a
book-illustrator, however, his landscape drawings
to Borrow's 'Wild Wales' represent another art
than that of the character-illustrator. Nor can
one pass over the drawings of Mr. Maurice
Greiffenhagen, also a contributor to the 'Pall Mall
Magazine,' if better known in illustrations to fiction
in 'The Ladies' Pictorial,' though in an article
on book-illustration he has nothing like his right
place. As an admirable and original technician and
draughtsman of society, swift in sight, excellent in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
expression, he ranks high among black-and-white
artists, while as a painter, his reputation, if based on
different qualities, is not doubtful.</p>

<p>Mr. Sullivan's drawings to 'Tom Brown's Schooldays'
(1896) are mechanical and mostly without
charm of handling, having an appearance of
timidity that is inexplicable when one thinks of
the vigorous news-drawings that preceded them.
The wiry line of the drawings appears in the
'Compleat Angler,' and in other books, including
'The Rivals' and 'The School for Scandal,' 'Lavengro'
and 'Newton Forster,' illustrated by the
artist in '96 and '97; but the decorative purpose
of Mr. Sullivan's later work is, in all these
books, effective in modifying its perversity. Increasing
elaboration of manner within the limits of
that purpose marks the transition between the
starved reality of 'Tom Brown' and the illustrations
to 'Sartor Resartus' (1898). These
emphatic decorations, and those illustrative of
Tennyson's 'Dream of Fair Women and other
Poems,' published two years later, are the drawings
most representative of Mr. Sullivan's intellectual
ideals. They show him, if somewhat indifferent
to charm, and capable of out-facing beauty suggested
in the words with statements of the extreme
definiteness of his own fact-conception, yet strongly
appreciative of the substance and purpose of the
text. Carlyle gives him brave opportunities, and
the dogmatism of the artist's line and form, his
speculative humour, working down to a definite
certainty in things, make these drawings unusually
interesting. Tennyson's 'Dream,' and his poems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
to women's names, are not so fit for the exercise of
Mr. Sullivan's talent. He imposes himself with
too much force on the forms that the poet suggests.
There is no delicacy about the drawings and no
mystery. They do not accord with the inspiration
of Tennyson, an inspiration that substitutes the exquisite
realities of memory and of dream for the
realities of experience. Mr. Sullivan's share of the
illustrations to White's 'Selborne' and to the
'Garden Calendar,' are technically more akin to the
Carlyle and Tennyson drawings than to other examples
by him. In these volumes he makes
fortunate use of the basis of exactitude on which
his work is founded, exactitude that includes portraiture
among the functions of the illustrator. No
portrait is extant of Gilbert White, but the presentment
of him is undertaken in a constructive spirit,
and, as in 'The Compleat Angler' and 'The Old
Court Suburb,' portraits of those whose names and
personalities are connected with the books are redrawn
by Mr. Sullivan.</p>

<p>Except Mr. Abbey, no character-illustrator of
the modern school has so long a record of work,
and so visible an influence on English contemporary
illustration, as Mr. Hugh Thomson. In popularity
he is foremost. The slight and apparently playful
fashion of his art, deriving its intention from the
irresistible gaieties of Caldecott, is a fashion to
please both those who like pretty things and those
who can appreciate the more serious qualities that
are beneath. For Mr. Thomson is a student of
literature. He pauses on his subject, and though
his invention has always responded to the suggestions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
of the text, the lightness of his later work is the
outcome of a selecting judgment that has learned
what to omit by studying the details and facts of
things. In rendering facial expression Mr. Thomson
is perhaps too much the follower of Caldecott, but
he goes much farther than his original master in
realization of the forms and manners of bygone
times. Some fashions of life, as they pass from
use, are laid by in lavender. The fashions of the
eighteenth century have been so laid by, and Mr.
Abbey and Mr. Thomson are alike successful in
giving a version of fact that has the farther charm
of lavender-scented antiquity.</p>

<p>When 'Days with Sir Roger de Coverley,'
illustrated by Hugh Thomson, was published in
1886, the young artist was already known by his
drawings in the 'English Illustrated,' and recognized
as a serious student of history and literature,
and a delightful illustrator of the times he studied.
His powers of realizing character, time, and place,
were shown in this earliest work. Sir Roger is a
dignified figure; Mr. Spectator, in the guise of
Steele, has a semblance of observation; and if Will
Wimble lacks his own unique quality, he is represented
as properly engaged about his 'gentleman-like
manufactures and obliging little humours.'
Mr. Thomson can draw animals, if not with the
possessive understanding of Caldecott, yet with
truth to the kind, knowledge of movement. The
country-side around Sir Roger's house&mdash;as, in a
later book, that where the vicarage of Wakefield
stands&mdash;is often delightfully drawn, while the leisurely
and courteous spirit of the essays is represented,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
with an appreciation of its beauty. 'Coaching
Days and Coaching Ways' (1888) is a picturesque
book, where types and bustling action picturesquely
treated were the subjects of the artist. The peopling
of high-road and county studies with lively figures
is one of Mr. Thomson's successful achievements,
as he has shown in drawings of the cavalier exploits
of west-country history, illustrative of 'Highways
and Byways of Devon and Cornwall,' and in episodes
of romance and warfare and humour in
similar volumes on Donegal, North Wales, and
Yorkshire. Here the presentment of types and
action, rather than of character, is the aim, but
in the drawings to 'Cranford' (1891), to 'Our
Village,' and to Jane Austen's novels, behaviour
rather than action, the gentilities and proprieties
of life and millinery, have to be expressed as a part
of the artistic sense of the books. That is, perhaps,
why Jane Austen is so difficult to illustrate. The
illustrator must be neither formal nor picturesque.
He must understand the 'parlour' as a setting for
delicate human comedy. Mr. Thomson is better
in 'Cranford,' where he has the village as the
background for the two old ladies, or in 'Our
Village,' where the graceful pleasures of Miss
Mitford's prose have suggested delightful figures
to the illustrator's fancy, than in illustrating Miss
Austen, whose disregard of local colouring robs
the artist of background material such as interests
him. Three books of verses by Mr. Austin Dobson,
'The Ballad of Beau Brocade' (1892), 'The Story
of Rosina,' and 'Coridon's Song' of the following
years, together with the illustrations to 'Peg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
Woffington,' show, in combination, the picturesque
and the intellectual interests that Mr. Thomson
finds in life. The eight pieces that form the first of
these volumes were, indeed, chosen to be reprinted
because of their congruity in time and sentiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
with Mr. Thomson's art. And certainly he works
in accord with the measure of Mr. Austin Dobson's
verses. Both author and artist carry their eighteenth-century
learning in as easy a way as though experience
of life had given it them without any
labour in libraries.</p>

<p>Mr. C. E. Brock and Mr. H. M. Brock are two
artists who to some extent may be considered as
followers of Mr. Thomson's methods, though Mr.
C. E. Brock's work in 'Punch,' and humorous
characterizations by Mr. H. M. Brock in 'Living
London,' show how distinct from the elegant fancy
of Mr. Thomson's art are the latest developments
of their artistic individuality. Mr. C. E. Brock's
illustrations to Hood's 'Humorous Poems' (1893)
proved his indebtedness to Mr. Thomson, and his
ability to carry out Caldecott-Thomson ideas with
spirit and with invention. An active sense of fun,
and facility in arranging and expressing his subject,
made him an addition to the school he represented,
and, as in later work, his own qualities and the
qualities he has adopted combined to produce
spirited and graceful art. But in work preceding
the pen-drawing of 1893, and in many books illustrated
since then, Mr. Brock at times has shown
himself an illustrator to whom matter rather than
a particular charm of manner seems of paramount
interest. In the illustrated Gulliver of 1894 there
is little trace of the daintiness and sprightliness of
Caldecott's illustrative art. He gives many particulars,
and is never at a loss for forms and details,
representing with equal matter-of-factness the
crowds, cities and fleets of Lilliput, the large details<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
of Brobdingnagian existence, and the ceremonies
and spectacles of Laputa. In books of
more actual adventure, such as 'Robinson Crusoe'
or 'Westward Ho,' or of quiet particularity, such
as Galt's 'Annals of the Parish,' the same directness
and unmannered expression are used, a directness
which has more of the journalistic than of the playful-inventive
quality. The Jane Austen drawings,
those to 'The Vicar of Wakefield,' and to a recent
edition of the 'Essays of Elia,' show the graceful
eighteenth-centuryist, while, whether he reports
or adorns, whether action or behaviour, adventure
or sentiment, is his theme, Mr. Brock is always an
illustrator who realizes opportunities in the text,
and works from a ready and observant intelligence.</p>

<p>Mr. Henry M. Brock is also an effective illustrator,
and his work increases in individuality and
in freedom of arrangement. 'Jacob Faithful'
(1895) was followed by 'Handy Andy' and
Thackeray's 'Songs and Ballads' in 1896. Less
influenced by Mr. Thomson than his brother, the
lively Thackeray drawings, with their versatility
and easy invention, have nevertheless much in
common with the work of Mr. Charles Brock.
On the whole, time has developed the differences
rather than the similarities in the work of these
artists. In the 'Waverley' drawings and in those
of 'The Pilgrim's Progress,' Mr. H. M. Brock
represents action in a more picturesque mood than
Mr. Charles Brock usually maintains, emphasizing
with more dramatic effect the action and necessity
for action.</p>

<p>The illustrations of Mr. William C. Cooke,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
especially those to 'Popular British Ballads' (1894),
and, with less value, those to 'John Halifax, Gentleman,'
may be mentioned in relation to the Caldecott
tradition, though it is rather of the art of Kate
Greenaway that one is reminded in these tinted
illustrations. Mr. Cooke's wash-drawings to Jane
Austen's novels, to 'Evelina' and 'The Man of Feeling,'
as well as the pen-drawings to 'British Ballads,'
have more force, and represent with some distinction
the stir of ballad romance, the finely arranged
situations of Miss Austen, and the sentiments of life,
as Evelina and Harley understood it.</p>

<p>In a study of English black-and-white art, not
limited to book-illustration, 'Punch' is an almost
inevitable and invaluable centre for facts. Few
draughtsmen of notability are outside the scheme
of art connected with 'Punch,' and in this connection
artists differing as widely as Sir John Tenniel
and Mr. Phil May, or Mr. Linley Sambourne
and Mr. Raven Hill, form a coherent group.
But, in this volume, 'Punch' itself is outside the
limits of subject, and, with the exception of Mr.
Bernard Partridge in the present, and Sir Harry
Furniss in the past, the wits of the pencil who
gather round the 'mahogany tree' are not among
character-illustrators of literature. Mr. Partridge
has drawn for 'Punch' since 1891, and has been
on the staff for nearly all that time. His drawings
of theatrical types in Mr. Jerome's 'Stage-land'
(1889)&mdash;which, according to some critics,
made, by deduction, the author's reputation as a
humorist&mdash;and to a first series of Mr. Anstey's
'Voces Populi,' as well as work in many of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
illustrated papers, were a substantial reason for
'Punch's' invitation to the artist. From the 'Bishop
and Shoeblack' cut of 1891, to the 'socials' and
cartoons of to-day, Mr. Partridge's drawings, together
with those of Mr. Phil May and of Mr.
Raven Hill, have brilliantly maintained the reputation
of 'Punch' as an exponent of the forms and
humours of modern life. His actual and intimate
knowledge of the stage, and his actor's observation
of significant attitudes and expressions, vivify his interpretation
of the middle-class, and of bank-holiday
makers, of the 'artiste,' and of such a special type
as the 'Baboo Jabberjee' of Mr. Anstey's fluent
conception. If his 'socials' have not the prestige
of Mr. Du Maurier's art, if his women lack charm
and his children delightfulness, he is, in shrewdness
and range of observation, a pictorial humorist
of unusual ability. As a book-illustrator, his most
'literary' work is in the pages of Mr. Austin
Dobson's 'Proverbs in Porcelain.' Studied from the
model, the draughtsmanship as able and searching
as though these figures were sketches for an 'important'
work, there is in every drawing the completeness
and fortunate effect of imagination. The
ease of an actual society is in the pose and grouping
of the costumed figures, while, in the representation
of their graces and gallantries, the artist
realizes <i>ce superflu si nécessaire</i> that distinguishes
dramatic action from the observed action of the
model. Problems of atmosphere, of tone, of
textures, as well as the presentment of life in
character, action, and attitude, occupy Mr. Partridge's
consideration. He, like Mr. Abbey, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the colourist's vision, and though the charm of
people, of circumstance, of accessories and of association
is often less his interest than characteristic
facts, in non-conventional technique, in style that
is as un-selfconscious as it is individual, Mr. Abbey
and Mr. Partridge have many points in common.</p>

<p>Sir Harry Furniss, alone of caricaturists, has, in
the many-sided activity of his career, applied
his powers of characterization to characters of
fiction, though he has illustrated more nonsense-books
and wonder-books than books of serious
narrative. Sir John Tenniel and Mr. Linley Sambourne
among cartoonists, Sir Harry Furniss, Mr.
E. T. Reed, and Mr. Carruthers Gould among
caricaturists, mark the strong connection between
politics and political individualities, and the irresponsible
developments and creatures of nonsense-adventures,
as a theme for art. To summarize
Sir Harry Furniss' career would be to give little
space to his work as a character-illustrator, but his
character-illustration is so representative of the
other directions of his skill, that it merits consideration
in the case of a draughtsman as effective
and ubiquitous in popular art as is 'Lika Joko.' The
pen-drawings to Mr. James Payn's 'Talk of the
Town,' illustrated by Sir Harry Furniss in 1885,
have, in restrained measure, the qualities of flexibility,
of imagination so lively as to be contortionistic,
of emphasis and pugnacity of expression, of
pantomimic fun and drama, that had been signalized
in his Parliamentary antics in 'Punch' for the preceding
five years. His connection with 'Punch'
lasted from 1880 to 1894, and the 'Parliamentary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
Views,' two series of 'M.P.s in Session,' and the
'Salisbury Parliament,' represent experience gained
as the illustrator of 'Toby M.P.' His high spirits
and energy of sight also found scope in caricaturing
academic art, 'Pictures at Play' (1888), being followed
by 'Academy Antics' of no less satirical
and brilliant purpose. As caricaturist, illustrator,
lecturer, journalist, traveller, the style and idiosyncrasies
of Sir Harry Furniss are so public and
familiar, and so impossible to emphasize, that a
brief mention of his insatiable energies is perhaps as
adequate as would be a more detailed account.</p>

<p>Other book-illustrators whose connection with
'Punch' is a fact in the record of their work are
Mr. A. S. Boyd and Mr. Arthur Hopkins. Mr.
Jalland, too, in drawings to Whyte-Melville used
his sporting knowledge on a congenial subject.
Mr. A. S. Boyd's 'Daily Graphic' sketches prepared
the way for 'canny' drawings of Scottish
types in Stevenson's 'Lowden Sabbath Morn,'
in 'Days of Auld Lang Syne,' and in 'Horace in
Homespun,' and for other observant illustrations to
books of pleasant experiences written by Mrs. Boyd.
Mr. Arthur Hopkins, and his brother Mr. Everard
Hopkins, are careful draughtsmen of some distinction.
Without much spontaneity or charm of
manner, the pretty girls of Mr. Arthur Hopkins,
and his well-mannered men, fill a place in the pages
of 'Punch,' while illustrations to James Payn's
'By Proxy,' as far back as 1878, show that the unelaborate
style of his recent work is founded on past
practice that has the earlier and truer Du Maurier
technique as its standard of thoroughness. Mr. E. J.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Wheeler, a regular contributor to 'Punch' since
1880, has illustrated editions of Sterne and of
'Masterman Ready,' other books also containing
characteristic examples of his rather precise, but
not uninteresting, work.</p>

<p>Save by stringing names of artists together on the
thread of their connection with some one of the illustrated
papers or magazines, it would be impossible
to include in this chapter mention of the enormous
amount of capable black-and-white art produced in
illustration of 'serial' fiction. Such name-stringing,
on the connection&mdash;say&mdash;of 'The Illustrated
London News,' 'The Graphic,' or 'The Pall Mall
Magazine,' would fill a page or two, and represent
nothing of the quality of the work, the attainment
of the artist. Neither is it practicable to summarize
the illustration of current fiction. One can only
attempt to give some account of illustrated literature,
except where the current illustrations of an
artist come into the subject 'by the way.' Mr.
Frank Brangwyn may be isolated from the group
of notable painters, including Mr. Jacomb Hood,
Mr. Seymour Lucas and Mr. R. W. Macbeth,
who illustrate for 'The Graphic,' by reason of his
illustrations to classics of fiction such as 'Don
Quixote' and 'The Arabian Nights,' as well as to
Michael Scott's two famous sea-stories. To some extent
his illustrations are representative of the large-phrased
construction of Mr. Brangwyn's painting,
especially in the drawings of the opulent orientalism
of 'The Arabian Nights,' with its thousand and one
opportunities for vivid art. Mr. Brangwyn's east
is not the vague east of the stay-at-home artist, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
of the conventional traveller; his imagination works
on facts of memory, and both memory and imagination
have strong colour and concentration in a mind
bent towards adventure. One should not, however,
narrow the scope of Mr. Brangwyn's art within the
limits of his work in black and white, and what is
no more than an aside in the expression of his individuality,
cannot, with justice to the artist, be
considered by itself. Other 'Graphic' illustrators&mdash;Mr.
Frank Dadd, Mr. John Charlton, Mr. William
Small, and Mr. H. M. Paget, to name a few only&mdash;represent
the various qualities of their art in black-and-white
drawings of events and of fiction, and the
'Illustrated,' with artists including Mr. Caton
Woodville, Mr. Seppings Wright, Mr. S. Begg,
M. Amedée Forestier and Mr. Ralph Cleaver, fills
a place in current art to which few of the more
recently established journals can pretend. Mr.
Frank Dadd and Mr. H. M. Paget made drawings
for the 'Dryburgh' edition of the Waverleys. In this
edition, too, is the work of well-known artists such as
Mr. William Hole, whose Scott and Stevenson illustrations
show his inbred understanding of northern
romance, and together with the character etchings
to Barrie, shrewd and valuable, represent with some
justice the vigour of his art; of Mr. Walter
Paget, an excellent illustrator of 'Robinson Crusoe,'
and of many boys' books and books of adventure, of
Mr. Lockhart Bogle, and of Mr. Gordon Browne.
In the same edition Mr. Paul Hardy, Mr. John
Williamson and Mr. Overend, showed the more
serious purpose of black and white that has
earned the appreciation of a public critical of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
failure in vigour and in realization&mdash;the public
that follows the tremendous activity of Mr. Henty's
pen, and for whom Dr. Gordon Stables, Mr. Manville
Fenn and Mr. Sydney Pickering write. Of M.
Amedée Forestier, whose illustrations are as popular
with readers of the 'Illustrated' and with the larger
public of novel-readers as they are with students of
technique, one cannot justly speak as an English
illustrator. He, and Mr. Robert Sauber, contributed
to Ward Lock's edition of Scott illustrated
by French artists. Their work, M. Forestier's so
admirable in realization of episode and romance,
Mr. Sauber's, vivacious up to the pitch of 'The
Impudent Comedian'&mdash;as his illustrations to Mr.
Frankfort Moore's version of Nell Gwynn's fascinations
showed&mdash;needs no introduction to an English
public. The black and white of Mr. Sauber and
of Mr. Dudley Hardy&mdash;when Mr. Hardy is in the
vein that culminated in his theatrical posters&mdash;has
many imitators, but it is not a style that is likely to
influence illustrators of literature. Mr. Hal Hurst
shows something of it, though he, and in greater
measure Mr. Max Cowper, also suggest the unforgettable
technique of Charles Dana Gibson.</p>

<h2><a name="IV_SOME_CHILDRENS-BOOKS_ILLUSTRATORS" id="IV_SOME_CHILDRENS-BOOKS_ILLUSTRATORS"></a>IV. SOME CHILDREN'S-BOOKS ILLUSTRATORS.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcap129l"><span class="dropcap">L</span></span>EIGH HUNT is one of many authors
gratefully to praise the best-praised
publisher of any day, Mr. Newbery,
who, at "The Bible and Sun" in St.
Paul's Churchyard, dispensed to long-ago
children 'Goody Two Shoes,'
'Beauty and the Beast,' and other less famous
little books, bound in gilt paper and rich with
many pictures. Charming memories prompt Leigh
Hunt's mention of the little penny books 'radiant
with gold,' that 'never looked so well as in adorning
literature,' and if the radiance of his estimate of
these nursery volumes is from an actual memory
of gilt-paper binding, his words exemplify the
spirit that makes right appreciation of the newest
picture-books so difficult.</p>

<p>In no other part of the subject of book-illustration
are the books of yesterday fraught with charm
so inimical to delight in the books of to-day. The
modern child's book&mdash;except, let us hope, to the
child-owner&mdash;is merely a book as other books are.
Its qualities are as patent as its size, or number of
illustrations. The pictures are to the credit or discredit
of a known and realized artist; they are,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
moreover, generally plain to see as a development
of the ideas of some 'school' or 'movement.'
One knows about them as examples of English
book-illustration of to-day. But the pictures
between the worn-out covers of the other child's
books were known with another kind of knowledge,
discovered in a long intimacy, and related,
not to any artist, or fashion of art, but to all manner
of unreasonable and delightful things.</p>

<p>So it is well, perhaps, that the break between a
subject of enthralling associations and a subject
whose associations are unsentimental, should, by the
ordering of facts, occur before the proper beginning
of a study of contemporary illustration in children's
books. For one reason or another, little work by
artists whose reputation is of earlier date than to-day
comes within present subject-limits. Some,
like Randolph Caldecott and Kate Greenaway, are
dead, some have ceased to draw, or draw no longer
for children. Happily, the witching drawings of
Arthur Hughes are still among nursery pictures,
in reprints of 'At the Back of the North Wind,'
and its companions&mdash;though the illustrator of these
books, of 'The Boy in Grey,' and of 'Tom
Brown's Schooldays,' has long ceased to weave his
fortunate dreams into pictures to content a child.
The drawings of Robert Barnes, of Mrs. Allingham
and of Miss M. E. Edwards&mdash;illustrators of a
sound tradition&mdash;are known to the present nursery
generation; and so are the outline and tinted
drawings of 'T. Pym,' who devised, so far back as
the seventies, the naïve and sympathetic style of
illustration that is pleasantly unchanged in recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
child-books, such as 'The Gentle Heritage'
(1893), and 'Master Barthemy' (1896). The
later work of Walter Crane is so bent to decorative
and allegorical purpose, that the creator of the best
nursery-rhyme pictures ever printed in colours&mdash;Randolph
Caldecott's are rather ballad than nursery-rhyme
pictures&mdash;is in his place among decorative
illustrators rather than in this connection. Sir John
Tenniel's neat, immortal little Alice, with her
ankle-strap shoes and pocketed apron, is still followed
to Wonderland by as many children as in
1866, when she and the splendid prototypes of the
degenerate jargon-beasts of to-day first captivated
attention. The drawings of these artists, and perhaps
also of 'E. V. B.'&mdash;for 'Child's Play,' though
published in 1858, is familiar to present children
in a reprint&mdash;are mentioned because of the place
they still take on nursery book-shelves. But from
such brief record of some among the books 'radiant
with gold' that 'never looked so well as in adorning
literature,' one must turn to work that has no
such radiance of sentiment and association over its
merits and defects.</p>

<p>Since the eighties Mr. Gordon Browne has been
in the forefront of illustrators popular with story-book
publishers and with readers of story-books.
He is the son of Hablot Browne, but no trace
of the 'caricaturizations' of 'Phiz' is in Mr.
Gordon Browne's work. Probably his earliest
published work appeared in 'Aunt Judy's Magazine'
some time in the seventies. These unenlivening
drawings suggest nothing of the picturesque
and unhesitating invention that has shaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
his style to its present serviceableness in the rapid
production of effective illustrations. The range
and quantity of his work is best realized in the
bibliographical list, which records his illustrations
to Shakespeare and Henty, to fairy-tales and boys'
stories, girls' stories and toy-books, Gulliver, Cervantes,
and Sunday-school books, at the rate of six
or seven volumes a year. In addition, one must
remember unnumbered illustrations in domestic
magazines. And, on the whole, the stories illustrated
by Gordon Browne are adequately illustrated.
It is true that as a general rule he illustrates stories
whose plan is within limits of familiarity, such as
those by Mrs. Ewing, Mrs. L. T. Meade, or, in a
different vein, the boys' stories of Henty, Manville
Fenn, or Ascott Hope. Romance and the clash of
swords engaged the artist in the pages of 'Sintram,'
of Froissart, of Sir Walter Scott, and&mdash;pre-eminently&mdash;in
the illustrations to the 'Henry
Irving Shakespeare,' numbering nearly six hundred,
and representing the work of five years. Illustrating
these subjects, though in varying degree, the vitality
and importance of an artist's conception of life
and of art is put to the test. So far as prompt and
definite representation of persons, places, and encounters,
and unflagging facility in devising effective
forms of composition constitute interpretation, the
artist maintained the level of the undertaking. The
illustration of stories such as those collected by the
brothers Grimm, or those Andersen discovered in
his exile of dreams among the facts of life, demands
a quality of thought differing from, yet hardly less
rare than, the thought needed to interpret Shakespeare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
A fine aptitude for discerning and rendering
'the mysterious face of common things,' a
fancy full of shapes, perception of the <i>rationale</i> of
magic, are essential to the writer or artist who
elects to send his fancy after the elusive forms of
fairyland. The recent drawings to Andersen, a
volume of tales from Grimm, published in 1894,
and illustrations to modern inventions, such as
'Down the Snow Stairs' (1886), and Mr. Andrew
Lang's 'Prince Prigio,' show that Mr. Gordon
Browne's ideas of fairyland, ancient and modern,
are no less brisk and picturesque than are his
ideas of everyday and of romance. His technique
is so familiar that it is surely unnecessary to make
even a brief disquisition on its merits in expressing
facts as they exist in a popular scheme of reality
and imagination. It is a healthy style, the ideals
of beauty and of strength are never coarse, wanton
or listless, the humour is friendly, and if the pathos
occasionally verges on sentimentality, the writer,
perhaps, rather than the artist is responsible.</p>

<p>Mr. Gordon Browne draws the average child,
and represents fun, fancy and adventure as the
average child understands them. His art is unsophisticated.
To him, the child is no <i>motif</i> in a
decorative fantasy, nor a quaint diagram figuring in
nursery-Gothic elements of design, nor a bold invention
among picture-book monsters. The artists
whose basis of art is the unadapted child, may, perhaps,
be classed as the 'realists' among children's
illustrators. Among these realists are the illustrators
of Mrs. Molesworth&mdash;with the exception
of Walter Crane, first and chief of them.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Leslie Brooke succeeded Mr. Crane in 1891
as the illustrator of Mrs. Molesworth's stories, and
the careful un-selfconscious fashion of his drawing,
his understanding of child-life and home-life as
known to children such as those of whom and for
whom Mrs. Molesworth writes, make these pen-drawings
true illustrations of the text. His drawings
are the result of individual observation and of
a sense of what is fit and pleasant, though neither
in his filling of a page, nor in the conception of
beauty, is there anything definitely inventive to be
marked. On the whole, his children and young
people are rather representative of a class that
maintains a standard of good looks among other
desirable things, than of a type of beauty; and if
they are not artistic types, neither are they strongly
individualized. In his 'everyday' illustrations
Mr. Leslie Brooke does not idealize, but that his
talent has a range of fancy is proved in illustrations
to 'A School in Fairyland' (1896), and to
some imaginings by Roma White. Graceful, regardful
of an unspoilt ideal in the fairies, elves and
flower-spirits, there are also frequent hints in these
drawings of the humour that finds more complete
expression in 'The Nursery Rhyme Book' of
1897, and in the happy extravagance of 'The
Jumblies' and 'The Pelican Chorus' (1900).
Outside the scope of picture-book drawings are
the dainty tinted designs to Nash's 'Spring Song,'
and the skilful pen-drawings to 'Pippa Passes.'</p>

<p>Mr. Lewis Baumer's drawings of children,
whether in 'The Boys and I' and other stories by
Mrs. Molesworth, or in less known child-stories,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
have distinction that is partly a development of an
admiration for Du Maurier, though Mr. Baumer
is too quick-sighted and appreciative of charm to
remain faithful to any model in art with the model
in life before his eyes. The children of Mr.
Baumer are of to-day. The effect of the earlier
'Punch' artist on
the work of the
younger man is
hardly more than
suggested in certain
felicities of pose and
expression added to
those that a delightful
kind of child
discovers to an observer
unusually
sensitive to the vivid
and engaging qualities
of his subject.
These children are
swift of movement
and of spirit, and
the <i>verve</i> of the artist's
style is rarely
forced, and still more rarely inadequate to the
occasion.</p>

<p>The acceptance of a formula, rather than the
expression of a hitherto unexpressed order of form,
is the basis of page-decoration by members of the
Birmingham School, whose work in its wider
aspect has already been considered. Originality
finds exercise in modifying details, but, pre-eminent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
over differences in style, is the similarity of style
that suggests 'Birmingham' before the variations
in detail suggest the work of an individual artist.
The influence of Kate Greenaway is strongly
marked in the work of many of these designers
for children's books. Indeed, Miss Winifred
Green's drawings to Charles and Mary Lamb's
'Poetry for Children,' and to 'Mrs. Leicester's
School,' contain figures that, if one allows for some
assertion necessary to justify their reappearance,
might have come direct from 'Under the Window.'</p>

<p>The typical illustrative art of Birmingham is,
however, of another kind. The quaint propriety
of 'old-fashioned' childhood, which Kate Greenaway's
delicate pencil first represented at its artistic
value, is akin to the conception of the child that
prevails on the pages decorated by Mrs. Arthur
Gaskin, but the work of Mrs. Gaskin shows nothing
of the Stothard-like ideal that seems to have been
the suggesting cause of 'Greenaway' play-pictures.
In the arabesques of flowers and leaves which
decorate many pages designed by Mrs. Gaskin
one sees a freedom and fluency of line that are
checked to quaintness and naïve angularity when
the child is the subject. Her conception of a
pictorial child is very definite, and in her later
work, one must confess, it is a conception hardly
corroborated by observation of fact. 'Horn Book
Jingles' and 'The Travellers' of 1897 and 1898
show the culmination of a style that had more
sympathetic charm in the tinted pages of the
'A. B. C.' (1895), or the 'Divine and Moral<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
Songs' of the following year. Book-illustration
is with Mrs. Gaskin, as with many members of the
school, only a part of craftsmanship.</p>

<p>Miss Calvert's winsome drawings in 'Baby Lays'
and 'More Baby Lays' are obviously related to the
drawings of Mrs. Gaskin, though observation of
real babies seems to have come between a rigid
adherence to the model. The decorative illustrations
by the Miss Holdens to 'Jack and the Beanstalk'
(1895), and to 'The Real Princess,' show
evidence of fancy that finds expression while
nothing of Mr. Gaskin's teaching is forgotten.</p>

<p>As different in spirit from the drawings of the
Birmingham designers as is the Lambs' 'Poetry for
Children' from 'A Child's Garden of Verses,' the
captivating illustrations of Mr. Charles Robinson
seem a direct pictorial evocation of the mood of
Stevenson's child's rhymes, or of Eugene Field's
lullabies. Familiar now, and exaggerated in imitations
and in some of the artist's later work, the
children and child-fantasies of Mr. Robinson, as
they were realized in the first unspoilt freshness of
improvisation, are among the delightful surprises of
modern book-illustration. In the pages of 'A
Child's Garden of Verses' (1896), of 'The Child
World,' and of Field's 'Lullaby Land,' the frolic
babes of his fancy play hide and seek wherever the
text leaves space for them, rioting, or attitudinizing
with spritely ceremony, from cover to cover.
The mood of imaginative play, of daylight make-believe
with its realistic and romantic excesses, and
of the make-believe enforced by flickering fire-light,
and by the shadows in the darkened house, is expressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
in Mr. Robinson's drawings. Not children, but
child's-play, and the unexplored shadows and mysteries
that lie 'up the mountain side of dreams' are
the motives of the fantasies he sets on the page
beside Stevenson's rhymes of old delights, and the
rhymes of the land of counterpane, where Wynken
Blynken and Nod, the Rockaby lady from Hushaby
Street, and all kind drowsy fancies close round and
shut away the crooked shadows into the night outside
the nursery.</p>

<p>The three books mentioned represent, as I think,
the artist's work at its truest value. There is variety
of touch and of method, and the heavier fact-enforcing
line of 'Child Voices,' of 'Lilliput Lyrics,'
or of the coloured pictures to 'Jack of all Trades'
is used, as well as the fanciful line of the by-the-way
drawings, and the arabesques and delicate detail
of the fantasy and dream pictures. A scheme of
solid black and white, connected and rendered fully
valuable by interweaving with line, white lines
telling against black masses, and black lines relieved
against white, with pattern as a resource to fill
spaces when plain black or plain white seem uninteresting,
is, of course, the scheme of the majority
of decorative illustrators. But of this scheme Mr.
Charles Robinson has made individual use. Whether
his lines trace a fairy's transparent wing on a background
of night-sky, of drifting cloud or of dream
mountain-side, or make the child visible among
dream-buildings, or seated on the world of fancy in
the immensity of night, or passing in a sleep-ship
through faëry seas, they have the quality of imagination,
imagination in their disposition to form a decorative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
effect, and in the forms they express. The
full-page drawings to 'King Longbeard' have this
quality, and hardly a drawing to any theme of fancy,
whether in old or in new fairy tales, or in verses,
but is the result of a vision of charm and distinction.</p>

<p>It would seem that the imagination of Mr.
Charles Robinson realizes a subject with more delight
when the text is suggestive, rather than impressive
with definite conceptions. The mighty
forms of 'The Odyssey,' the chivalric symbolism of
'Sintram and Aslaugas Knight,' even the magical
particularity of Hans Andersen, are not, apparently,
supreme in his imagination, as is his vision of fairy-seeing
childhood. One is unenlightened by the
graceful drawings to 'The Adventures of Odyseus,'
or the romances of De la Motte Fouqué.</p>

<p>That Miss Alice Woodward has, on occasion,
made one of the many illustrators who have profited
by the example of Mr. Charles Robinson, various
drawings seem to show, but few of these illustrators
have the originality and purpose that allow Miss
Woodward to enlarge her range of expression without
nullifying the spontaneity of her work. She
has illustrated over a dozen books, beginning with
'Banbury Cross' in 1895, and mostly she treats
her subject with humour and variety and with a
consistent idea of the pictorial aspect of things.
She has quick appreciation of unconscious humour
in attitude and in expression, though she seems
at times to rely too much on memory, thereby
diminishing vividness. When most successful she
can draw a pleasing child with lines almost as
few as those used by any modern artist. Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
Gertrude Bradley is another pleasant illustrator.
Her later drawings of children are modified from
the print-pinafore freshness of those in 'Songs for
Somebody' (1893), to a type that has evident
affinities with the Charles Robinson child, though
in 'Just Forty Winks' (1897) Miss Bradley proves
her individual sense of humour. The taking simplicity
of Miss Marion Wallace-Dunlop's illustrations
of elf-babies in 'Fairies, Elves and Flower
Babies,' and of the human twins who adventure in
'The Magic Fruit Garden' also suggests the influence
of the fortunate inventor of an admirable
child.</p>

<p>The greater amount of Mr. Bedford's work for
children consists of coloured illustrations to nursery-books,
and, when the humour of half-penny paper
journalism is supposed to be entertainment for
babies, one may be thankful for the pleasant and
peaceful drawings of this artist. Little Miss Muffet,
Wee Willie Winkie, and the activities of town and
country, are a relief from the <i>jeunesse dorée</i>, and the
lethargy of the War Office as toy-book subjects,
while 'The Battle of the Frogs and Mice'&mdash;though
Miss Barlow's version of Aristophanes, with Mr.
Bedford's effective decorations, is hardly a nursery-book&mdash;is
a better child's subject than the punishable
pretensions of other nations.</p>

<p>In work hitherto noticed, the child may be regarded
as the central figure of the design, whether
fact or fancy be set about his little personality.
Besides the illustrators whose subject is childhood
in some aspect or another, and those children's
illustrators who pictorialize the wide imaginings of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
the national fairy tales, there are others in whose
work the child figures incidentally, but not as the
central fact. In this connection one may consider
those draughtsmen who illustrate modern wonder-books
with Zankiwanks, Krabs and Wallypugs.</p>

<p>Mr. Archie Macgregor should be classed, perhaps,
among artists of the child in wonderland,
but the personalities of Tomakin and his sisters,
though Judge Parry sets them forth in prose and
in verse with his usual high spirits, are not the
illustrator's first care. 'Katawampus,' 'The First
Book of Krab,' and 'Butterscotia,' have made Mr.
Macgregor's robust and strongly-defined drawings
familiar, and, within the limits of the author's
hearty imagination, his droll and unflagging representations
of adventures, ceremonies and humours,
are extremely apt. Children, goblins, animals and
queer monsters are drawn with unhesitating spirit
and humour, and with decorative invention that
would be even more successful if it were less fertile
in devising detail. More fortunate in rendering
action than facial expression, without the mystery
that is the atmosphere of the magical fairy-land, the
fact and fancy of Mr. Macgregor are so admirably
illustrative of Judge Parry's text that one is almost
inclined to attribute the absence of glamour to the
artist's strong conception of the function of an
illustrator.</p>

<p>Mr. Alan Wright's work, again, is inevitably
associated with the invention of an author, though
Mr. Farrow's 'Wallypug' books have not all been
illustrated by one artist. Mr. Wright's drawings
are proof of an energetic and serviceable conception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of all sorts of out-of-the-way things. His
humour is unelaborate, he goes straight to the
fact, and, having expressed its extraordinary and
fantastic characteristics, he does not linger to develop
his drawing into a decorative scheme.
Apparently he draws 'out of his head,' whether
his subject is fact or extravagance. The three
small humans who figure in 'The Little Panjandrum's
Dodo,' and the ambassador's son of 'The
Mandarin's Kite,' are as briefly sketched as the
whimsicalities with whom they consort.</p>

<p>Mr. Arthur Rackham's illustrations to 'Two
Old Ladies, Two Foolish Fairies, and a Tom-Cat'
(1897), and to 'The Zankiwank and the Bletherwitch'
show inspiriting talent for nursery extravaganza.
The children, whirled from reality into
a phantasmagoria of adventure, are deftly and
happily drawn, the fairies have fairy grace, and the
rout of hobgoblins and grotesques fill their parts.
Drawing real animals, Mr. Rackham is equally
quick to note what is characteristic, and his facility
in realizing fact and magic finds expression in the
illustrations to 'Grimm's Fairy Tales' (1900).
This is the most important work of Mr. Rackham
as a child's illustrator, and if the drawings are
somewhat calculated to impress the horrid horror
of witches and forest enchantments on uneasy minds,
the charm of princesses and peasant maids, the
sagacious humour of talking animals and the
grotesque enlivenment of cobolds and gnomes are
no less vividly represented. That Mr. Rackham
admires Mr. E. J. Sullivan's scheme of decorative
black-and-white is evident in these drawings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
but not to the detriment of their inventive
worth.</p>

<p>Mr. J. D. Batten, Mr. H. J. Ford, and Mr. H.
R. Millar represent, in various ways, the modern
art of fairy-tale illustration at its best. Mr. Batten's
connection with Mr. Joseph Jacob's treasuries of
fairy-lore, Mr. Ford's long record of work in the
multicoloured fairy and true story books edited by
Mr. Lang, and the drawings of Mr. Millar in
various collections of fairy tales, entitle them to a
foremost place among contemporary illustrators of
the world's immortal wonder-stories.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Batten knows the rules of chivalry, of sentiment,
humour, and horridness, as they exist in the
magical convention of the real fairy-tales, and
whether their purpose be merry or sad, heroic or
grotesque, he illustrates the old tales of Celt and
Saxon, of India, Arabia and Greece with appreciation
of the largeness and splendour of their conception.
One might wish for more vitality in his
women, and think that a representation of the
mournful beauty of Deirdre, the passion of Circe
or of Medea, should differ from the untroubled
sweetness of the King's daughter of faery. Still
one appreciates the dignity of these smooth-browed
women, and, after all, the passionate figures of
Greek and Celtic epics need translation before they
can figure in fairy-tale books. Mr. Batten's ideas
are never trite and never morbid. His giants are
gigantic, his monsters of true devastating breed, and
his drawings&mdash;especially the later ones&mdash;are as able
technically as they are apt to the occasion.</p>

<p>There can hardly be an existent fairy-story among
the hundreds told before the making of books that
Mr. Ford has not illustrated in one version or another.
The telling-house of every nation has yielded
stories for Mr. Lang's annual volumes; and since
the appearance of 'The Blue Fairy Book' in 1888,
Mr. Ford, alone or in collaboration with Mr. Jacomb
Hood, Mr. Lancelot Speed and other well-known
artists, has illustrated the stories Mr. Lang has
gathered. Moreover, in addition to seven volumes
of fairy tales, and many true story and animal story
books, Mr. Ford has made drawings for Æsop, for
the 'Arabian Nights,' and for 'Early Italian Love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Stories.' His decorative and illustrative ideal has
never lacked distinction, and his recent work is the
coherent development of that of fourteen years ago,
though he has gained in freedom and variety of
conception and in quality of expression. Mr. Ford's
art is obviously founded on that of Walter Crane,
but he looks at a subject with greater interest in its
dramatic possibilities, and in the facts of place and
time than the later 'Crane' convention admits.
An abundant fancy, familiarity with the facts of
legendary, romantic and animal life, over a wide
tract of country and through long ages of time, fill
the decorative pages of the artist with a plentitude
of graceful, vigorous and persuasive forms. The
well-devised pages of Miss Emily J. Harding's
'Fairy Tales of the Slav Peasants and Herdsmen,'
are akin in form to the drawings of Mr. Batten and
of Mr. Ford, though regard for the national tone of
the stories gives these illustrations individuality and
interest.</p>

<p>The principles of art represented by the drawings
of Mr. Ford have little in common with those which
determine the scheme of Mr. Millar's many illustrations.
Vierge, and Gigoux, the master of Vierge,
are the indubitable suggesters of his style, and the
antitheses of sheer black and white, the audacities,
evasions and accentuations of these jugglers with line
and form, are dexterously handled by Mr. Millar.
He has not invented his convention, he has accepted
it, and begun original work within accepted limits.
A less original artist would thereby have doomed
himself to extinction, but Mr. Millar has a lively
apprehension of romance, especially in an oriental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
setting, and interest in subject is incompatible with
merely imitative work. Illustrations to 'Hajji Baba'
(1895), and to 'Eothen,' show how dramatic and
true to picturesque notions of the East are the conceptions,
and the same vigour projects itself into
themes of western adventure in 'Frank Mildmay'
and 'Snarleyow.' But his right to be considered
here is determined by the rapid visions of fairy
romance realized in the pages of 'Fairy Tales by
Q.' (1895), of 'The Golden Fairy Book' with
its companions, and on the more concrete but not
less sufficient drawings to 'The Book of Dragons,'
and 'Nine Unlikely Tales for Children.'</p>

<p>The pen-drawings of Mr. T. H. Robinson in the
"Andersen" illustrated by the brother artists, show
ability to realize not only the incidents and ideas of
the stories, but also something of the national inspiration
that is an element in all <i>märchen</i>. At times
determinedly decorative, his work is generally in
closer alliance with actuality than is the typical work
of Mr. Charles or of Mr. W. H. Robinson. Character,
action, costume, picturesque facts of life and
scenery are suggested, and suggested with interest
in the actual geographical and chronological circumstances
of the stories, whether a poet's Denmark,
the Arabia of Scheherazade, the Greece of Kingsley's
'The Heroes,' or the rivers and mountains of
Carmen Sylva's stories determine the fact-scheme
for his decorative invention. In addition to these
vigorous and generally harmonious illustrations, the
artist's drawings to 'Cranford,' 'The Scarlet Letter,'
'Lichtenstein,' 'The Sentimental Journey,' and
'Esmond,' prove his interest and inventive sense to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
be effective in realizing actual historical and local
conditions. If Mr. W. H. Robinson is also an apt
illustrator of legends and of folk-tales, whose setting
demands attention to the facts of life as they were
to story-tellers in far countries of once-upon-a-time,
the more individual side of his talent is discovered
in work of wilder and more intense fancy. Andersen's
'Marsh King's Daughter,' the Snow Queen
with her frozen eyes, the picaresque mood of Little
Claus, or the doom of proud Inger, are to his mind,
and in illustrations to 'Don Quixote' (1897), to
'The Pilgrim's Progress,' and especially in the fully
decorated volume of Poe's 'Poems,' the forcible
conceptions of the text find pictorial expression.</p>

<p>Mr. A. G. Walker, though a sculptor by profession,
claims notice as an illustrator of various
children's books, notably 'The Lost Princess'
(1895), 'Stories from the Faerie Queene' (1897),
and 'The Book of King Arthur.' His pen-drawings
are expressive of a thoughtful realization of the
subject in its actual and moral beauty. The nobility
of Spenser's conceptions, the remote beauty of the
Arthurian legend, appeal to him, and the careful
rendering of costume, landscape and the aspect of
things, is only part of a scheme of execution that
has as its complete intention the rendering of the
'mood' of the narrative. These drawings are realizations
rather than illuminations of the text, and
one appreciates their thoroughness, clearness, and
dignity.</p>

<p>Miss Helen Stratton published some pleasant but
not very vigorous drawings of children in 'Songs
for Little People' (1896), and illustrations to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
selection from Andersen suggested the later direction
of her ability. This, as the copiously illustrated
'Fairy Tales from Hans Christian Andersen' (1899),
and the large number of drawings contributed to
Messrs. Newnes' edition of 'The Arabian Nights,'
show, is in realizing themes less actual than those of
Nursery Lyrics. A sense of drama in the pose and
grouping of the multitudes of figures on the pages
of the Danish and Arabian stories, and a sufficient
care for the background, as the poet's eyes might
have seen it behind the dream-figures that passed between
him and reality, are qualities that give Miss
Stratton's competent work imaginative value.</p>

<p>The work of Miss R. M. M. Pitman comes within
the subject in her illustrations to Lady Jersey's fairy
tale, 'Maurice and the Red Jar,' and to 'The
Magic Nuts' of Mrs. Molesworth. But though
their decorative intention and technique represent
the forms of the artist's work, the spirit of fantasy
that informs her illustrations to 'Undine' finds only
modified expression. The symbolism of 'Undine'
is wrought into decorations of inventive elaborateness.
The technical ideal of Miss Pitman suggests
study of Dürer's pen-drawing, and though at times
there is too much sweetness and luxury in her representation
of beauty, at her best she expresses free
fancy with distinction not common in modern book-illustration.</p>

<p>Brief allusion only&mdash;where drawings of more
definitely illustrative purpose over-crowd the available
space&mdash;can be made to the numerous animal
books, serious and comic. Mr. Percy J. Billinghurst's
full-page designs to 'A Hundred Fables of Æsop,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
'A Hundred Fables of La Fontaine,' and 'A
Hundred Anecdotes of Animals' deserve more than
passing mention for their decorative and observant
qualities and their enlivening humour. Another decorative
draughtsman of animals for children's books
is Mr. Carton Moore Park, who, since 1899, when
the 'Alphabet of Animals' and 'The Book of Birds'
appeared, has published seven or eight volumes of
his strongly devised designs. One can hardly conclude
without reference to Mr. Louis Wain, the cats'
artist of twenty years' standing, and to Mr. J. A.
Shepherd, chief caricaturist of animals; but while
toy-book artists such as Mrs. Percy Dearmer, Mrs.
Farmiloe, Miss Rosamond Praeger, Mr. Aldin, and
Mr. Hassall (whose subject&mdash;the child&mdash;takes precedence
of Zoological subjects) must be left unconsidered,
the humourists of the Zoo can hardly be
included.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
